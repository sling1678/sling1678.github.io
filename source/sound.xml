    <introduction>
    	<p>
    		Sound is a mechanical wave that is responsible for the sensory experience of hearing.  We can hear a sound wave in air if its frequency lies between <m>20\text{ Hz}</m> and <m>20\text{ kHz}</m>. This range of frequencies is called the <term>audible</term> range.  Sound waves of frequencies above <m>20\text{ kHz}</m> are called <term>ultrasound</term>, and those below <m>20\text{ Hz}</m> the <term>infrasound</term>. 
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		At the source, sound waves are generated by vibrating objects, such as the vocal chord, a guitar string, membrane of a drum, spaker, etc., and propagate through a medium, most commonly air, from one location to another.  Sound is also detected by sound vibrating a membrane, e.g., in the ear drum and in microphone. Since sound is a mechanical wave, it has all the properties of mechanical waves we have described in a previous chapter.
