    <title>Stars, Galaxies, and Universe INPROGRESS</title>

    <p>
        To an untrained eye the night sky appears to be a canopy of light bulbs with interesting patterns, some bright, some faint, and some hazy areas. After many centuries of curiosity about these lights much progress in our understanding of these light sources has been made in the last century. We now know that most of the light sources in the night sky are stars, just like the Sun, and galaxies, and even when we cannot see them during the day light of the Sun, they are still there.  Stars are attracted to each other and form galaxies. Galaxies form clusters, and clusters of galaxies also form even larger structures, and so on. Modern observational instruments and theories have made it possible to understand even the origin of the universe. In this chapter we will review some of these developments.
