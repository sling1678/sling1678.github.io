<section xml:id="Damping-by-Resistance"><title> Damping by Resistance </title>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			There is no resistance in the ideal LC circuit in which even the resistance in teh wires is ignored.  In reality, however, there is always some resistance in the circuit, for instance in the connecting wires and the materials of the inductor and the capacitor, which dissipate energy.  Dissipation of energy from the circuit results in a decrease in current over time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Oscillatory circuits also radiate electromagnetic waves and lose energy through radiation.  We will not discuss the radiation of energy now, and assume that the loss by radiation is negligible compared to the loss due to resistance. 
		</p>
		<p>
			To understand the phenomenon of resistive damping better consider a circuit with a resistor <m>R</m> in series with a capacitor <m>C</m> and an inductor <m>L</m> as shown in <xref ref="fig-rlc-circuits-basic"/>. 
		</p>
		<sidebyside widths="50% 10% 40%">

				Let the capacitor be charged initially with charges <m>\pm Q_0</m> on the plates so that there is a voltage <m>V_0 = Q_0/C</m> at time <m>t=0</m> between the capacitor plates.

			When the switch is closed at <m>t=0</m>, current in the circuit will rise from zero to a maximum value, and then, depending on the values of <m>R/2L</m> vs <m>1/\sqrt{LC} </m>, current will oscillate with decreasing amplitude or simply damp out as illustrated in <xref ref="fig-current-damped-oscillators"/> below. Three types of behavior are seen.
		</p>
		<ol>
 			<li> <term>Underdamped</term> Case. If <m> R/2L \lt 1/\sqrt{LC}</m>, then  current in the circuit oscillates about the equilibrium value of zero, successively damping out each cycle.  </li>
 			<li>
 				<term>Over-damped</term> Case. If <m> R/2L \gt 1/\sqrt{LC}</m>, then  current in the circuit does not oscillate; current just damps out to zero.
 			</li>
 			<li>
 				<term>Critically Damped</term> Case. If <m> R/2L = 1/\sqrt{LC}</m>, then  current in the circuit does not oscillate; current just damps out to zero rather quickly.
 			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			These three types of behavior of the circuit are <!-- 
			solutions of the Faraday loop equation of the circuit is --> more compactly presented by using the following combination of constants.

				<mrow>\amp \omega_1 = \sqrt{ \omega_0^2 - \gamma^2/4 },\ \ \  \alpha = \sqrt{ \gamma^2/4 - \omega_0^2 }</mrow>
			</mdn>
			For underdapmed <m>\omega_1</m> is the angular frequency of oscillations and <m>\omega_0</m> is the angular frequency when there is no damping. Sometimes <m>\omega_0</m> is also called <term>natural frequency</term>. Constant <m>\gamma</m> is called the <term>damping</term> parameter. Constant <m>\alpha </m> is a positive real number in overdamped case.

			After solving Eq. <xref ref="eq-motion-of-q-in-damped-circuit-diff-eq"/> for <m>q</m>, derived for the RLC-circuit below, we can get current by <m>I=dq/dt</m>. We find that

			The under-damped case provides a physical meaning for the damping parameter <m>\gamma</m>.  We see from the graph in Fig. \ref{fig:RLC-circuit-damped-3} that it takes a time of <m>1/\beta</m>  for the envelope of the oscillations to decrease by 1/e of its original value.  The time to relax to <m>1/e</m> of the original amplitude is called the {\bf time constant} of the oscillator, which is also denoted by the Greek letter <m>\tau</m>.  
			<me>
			\boxed{\tau = \frac{1}{\beta}.}
			</me>
			Therefore, the larger the damping constant, the shorter the time constant, and consequently, faster the damping.

	<subsection><title> Meaning of <m>\gamma</m></title>
		<p>
			To gain an understanding of the meaning of the damping parameter <m>\gamma</m> we look at underdamped oscillatory circuit. You will notice that the envelop of oscillations, i.e., the plot that has peaks or troughs as their points, falls off with time exponentially. The time for peak current to fall off to a fraction <m>\dfrac{1}{e}</m> of its max at some time is equal to <m>2/\gamma</m> as illustrated in <xref ref="fig-current-damped-oscillators-envelops" />.
		</p>
		<figure xml:id="fig-current-damped-oscillators-envelops">

				Envelops of an underdamped oscillations illustrate the time for current in the envelop to drop to <m>1/e</m> of the initial value is <m>2/\gamma</m>. Parameters used for plot: <m>R = 0.25\,\Omega</m>, <m>C=1\text{ F}</m>, <m>L = 1\text{ H}</m>. The initial state: <m>q(0) = Q_0</m> and <m>I(0)=0</m>.

			The energy of the circuit is given by
			<me>
				U_\text{circuit} = \frac{1}{2}LI^2 + \frac{1}{2}CV_C^2. 
			</me>
			This also oscillates and decays with time. Its envelop drops twice as fast as that shown in <xref ref="fig-current-damped-oscillators-envelops"/> for the current. The time taken for energy envelop to drop by <m>1/e</m> is equal to <m>1/\gamma</m>. This is called time constant of the circuit.

	<subsection><title>Quality Factor Q of an Oscillator </title>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			<term> Quality factor</term> provides a standard way to talk about goodness of an oscillator. We denote Quality factor by <m> Q</m>. A simple measure of Quality of an oscillator would be to divide the average energy in a particular cycle by the energy lost in the cycle, so that the less the energy is lost in a cycle, the more persistent are the oscillations, and therefore, higher the Quality.  
		</p>
		<p>
			For technical reasons, we define <m> Q </m> factor by dividing the energy at the beginning of a cycle to the energy lost in <m> \dfrac{1}{2\pi}</m> of a cycle. The factor is not critical to the definition, but does give simpler formula when we apply this to a lightly damped oscillator. Suppose <m>U(t)</m> be the energy at time <m>t</m>, then we would compute <m>Q</m> by
			<men>
				Q = \dfrac{U(t)}{\left| \Delta U\left(\text{during }t\text{ to }t+ \dfrac{1}{\omega}\right) \right| };.
			</men>					
		</p>

		<p>
			We get a simple formula for <m>Q</m> when oscillator is a good oscillator, for instance, when
			<men>
				\gamma \lt\lt \omega_0.
			</men>
			Under these conditions, the oscillator is called a lightly damped oscillator. For lightly damped case, energy envelop decreases exponentially and is given by
			<men>
				U(t) = U(0) e^{-\gamma t}.
			</men>
			It is then easy to work out energy lost during interval from <m> t=t</m> to <m> t=t + \dfrac{1}{\omega} </m>. The quality factor obtained by this calculation is
			<men>
				Q = \dfrac{\omega_0}{\gamma} = \dfrac{\sqrt{L}}{R\sqrt{C}}\ \ \ \ \ (\text{lightly damped oscillator})
			</men>
			<alert> Often, we use this formula, even when the underdamped oscillator is not lightly damped.</alert> In those cases, we just replace <m> \omega </m> in this formula by <m> \omega_1</m>, the actual angular frequency of the damped oscillator.
			<men>
				Q \sim \dfrac{\omega_1}{\gamma}\ \ \ \ \ (\text{underdamped oscillators})
			</men>			
		</p>
		<p>
			Good mechanical oscillators such as tuning forks and guitar strings have <m> Q</m> values in the thousands.  Laser cavities, which are electromagnetic wave oscillators, have much higher <m> Q</m> values, exceeding <m>10^7</m>.  Of course, the undamped oscillator has zero  <m> \gamma</m>, and hence infinite <m>Q</m>.  <alert> There is no <m> Q</m> for the critically damped and overdamped cases since they do not oscillate</alert>. You might say, their <m> Q = 0</m>.

			<me>
				\dfrac{d^2 q}{d t^2} + \gamma\, \dfrac{dq}{dt}  + \omega_0^2\, q = 0.

			Let us make the following substitution.

					<mrow> \amp  \omega_0 = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{5\times 10^{-3}\:\text{H}\times 2\times 10^{-6}\:\text{F}}} = 10,000\:\text{sec}^{-1}.</mrow>
				</md>
				Since <m>\omega_0 \lt \beta</m>, this circuit is over-damped.
