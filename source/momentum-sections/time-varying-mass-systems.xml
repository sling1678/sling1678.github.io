		<p>
			There are many systems of interest in which the mass of the system is not constant in time. For instance, a rocket loses fuel when it is in the accelerating phase, a squid propels itself forward by ejecting water from back, etc.
		</p>

		<!-- <p>
			In many situations, you find that an object accelerates even in the absence of an external force.  For instance, a rocket lifts off without anyone actually pushing up on it, a squid  propels itself forward without anyone pushing forward on it, etc.     
		</p> -->
		<p>
			In these examples object of interest accelerates even in the absence of an external force, apparently violating <m>\vec F = m\vec a</m>. The reason is that <m>\vec F = m\vec a</m> is not correct if <m>m</m> changes with time. We need the general form of second law of motion in terms of momentum, either in its differential form or integral form.
			<men>
				\vec F = \frac{\Delta \vec p}{\Delta t} \rightarrow \dfrac{d\vec p}{dt}, \ \ \leftrightarrow\ \ \vec J = \int \vec F dt = \Delta \vec p .
			</men>
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides needing to work with <m>\vec J = \Delta \vec p</m>, there is also a question of what is <alert>included in the system</alert> and what is not. A good way to proceed is to look at how momentum changes in an infinitesimal interval of time <m>\Delta t</m>. We will work out examples to show this method below.

	<subsection><title>Motion of a Rocket in Free Space</title>
		<p>
			Consider a rocket far away from planets and stars so that we can focus exclusively on effects of changing mass. Let <m>m(t)</m> be the mass of the rocket and <m>v_x(t)</m> be its <m>x</m>-velocity at instant <m>t</m> with respect to a fixed frame as shown in <xref ref="fig-rocket-in-free-space"/>.
		</p>

		<p>
			During interval <m>t</m> to  <m>t + \Delta t</m>, burnt fuel of mass <m>\Delta m</m> is ejected from back. Let us assume that the ejected gas has speed <m>u</m> <em>with respect to the rocket</em> at instant <m>t</m>. The remainder of the rocket has mass <m>m(t)-\Delta m</m> and has <m>x</m>-velocity <m>
			v_x + \Delta v_x</m> with respect to the fixed frame. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The interval between <m>t</m> to <m>t+\Delta t</m> is just like one-dimensional explosion problems you have studied. To apply conservation of momentum with respect to the fixed frame, we will need to express all velocities with respect to the fixed frame. The <m>x</m>-velocity of the ejected fueld with respect to the fixed frame will be <m>v_x -u</m>.

			The <m>x</m>-equation of conservation of momentum will be
			<me>
				m v_x = |\Delta m| (  v_x   -u ) + (  m - |\Delta m| ) (v_x + \Delta v_x).
			</me>
			Note that <m>|\Delta m \Delta v_x| \ll |u\Delta m| \text{ or } | m\Delta v_x| </m>, we drop <m>\Delta m \Delta v_x</m>. This gives the following relation.
			<me>
				m \Delta v_x = u |\Delta m|.
			</me>
		</p>
		<p>
			<idx>Rocket Equation</idx>
			Dividing by <m>\Delta t</m> we obtain the correct equation of motion for a rocket, which is sometimes called <term>rocket equation</term>. 
			<me>
				m \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} = u \frac{|\Delta m|}{\Delta t}.
			</me>
			Now, when we take <m>\Delta t \rightarrow 0</m> limit, we obtain the equation at instant <m>t</m> as a differential equation. Here, we need to observe that <m>|\Delta m|/\Delta t</m> should be positive but mass is decreasing. So, <m>|\Delta m|/\Delta t</m> will go over to <m>-dm/dt</m> rather than <m>dm/dt</m>.
			<men xml:id="eq-rocket-equation-non-calculus">
				m \frac{d v_x}{d t} = - u \frac{d m}{d t}.
			</men>
		</p>
		<p>
			<idx>Thrust</idx>
			Left side is <m>m a_x</m> and right side is caled the force of <term>thrust</term> provided by the ejecting burnt fuel. 
			This equation can be solved by calculus to give the following expression for the final velocity <m>v_f</m>, when mass of the rocket has gone from <m>m_i</m> to <m>m_f</m>.
			<men>
				v_{x,f} = v_{x,i} + u \ln\frac{m_i}{m_f}.
			</men>
			<remark>
				<p>
					We give the missing steps here. First we multiply both sides of Eq. <xref ref="eq-rocket-equation-non-calculus"/> by <m>dt/m</m>. This gives
					<me>
						d v_x  = - u \frac{d m}{m}.
					</me>
					Now, integrating from <m>t=t_i</m> to <m>t=t_f</m> has limits <m>v_{x,i}\,\text{to}\, v_{x,f}</m> on the left side and the limits <m>m_i\,\text{to}\, m_f</m> on the right side.
					<me>
						\int_{v_{x,i}}^{v_{x,f}}d v_x  = -\int_{m_i}^{m_f}u \frac{d m}{m}.
					</me>
					Since <m>dm/m = d(\ln\,m)</m> and <m>u</m> is independent of <m>m</m>, we immediately get
					<me>
						v_{x,f} - v_{x,i} = - u \ln\frac{m_f}{m_i}.
					</me>
				</p>
			</remark>				
		</p>
<!-- 		<p><alert>(Requires Calculus)</alert></p>
		<p>
			In Eq. <xref ref="eq-rocket-equation-non-calculus"/>, suppose we consider <m>m</m> as a function of <m>t</m>, then, <m>m(t)</m> will be a decreasing function of <m>t</m>. Taking <m>\Delta t\rightarrow 0</m> limit in Eq. <xref ref="eq-rocket-equation-non-calculus"/> will mean we replace right side by <m>-dm/dt</m>. With negative sign <m>-dm/dt</m> will be positive, as we required for increasing <m>v</m>. Therefore, we have the following differential equation, which is the actual <term>rocket equation</term>.
			<men xml:id="eq-rocket-equation-calculus">
				m \frac{d v}{d t} = -u \frac{d m}{dt}.
			</men>			
			To solve this differential equation, we rewrite this as
			<me>
				dv = -u \frac{d m}{m}.
			</me>
			Now, we integrate this to get
			<me>
				v_f - v_i = -u \ln\frac{m_f}{m_i},
			</me>
			where subscripts <m>i</m> and <m>f</m> denote quantity at initial and final instants respectively. We rearrange this equation in the following form commonly used in problems.

		<!-- <p>
			When we take infinitesimal time limit in Eq. <xref ref="eq-rocket-equation-non-calculus"/>, this equation will become a differential equation. But, we need to be careful when we convert <m>\Delta m/\Delta t</m> to <m>dm/dt</m> since <m>m</m> of the rocket is decreasing and <m>dm/dt</m> will be negative while <m>\Delta m/\Delta t</m> was positive.

<!-- 
		<p>
			Consider a rocket in gravity-free space with total mass <m> M </m> of which <m> M_f </m> be the fuel. The rocket is cruizing at constant speed of <m> v_0 </m> and  starts to fire up at <m> t = 0 </m> ejecting burnt fuel from back of the rocket till it runs out of fuel. The burnt fuel comes out from the back at a constant speed <m> u </m> with respect to the rocket. We wish to find the speed of the rocket at an arbitrary time <m> t </m> before the rocket runs out of fuel.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since there are no external forces on the (rocket <m>+</m> fuel) system, their combined momentum cannot change. Let us look at what happens during a period <m> t </m> to <m> t + \Delta t </m>. Since the motion will be along some line, we pick that line to be the <m> x </m> axis of an inertial frame.

		<p>
			Let <m> v_x </m> denote the <m> x  </m> component of the velocity of the rocket at instant <m> t </m> and let <m> \Delta v_x </m> be the change in it during the interval. Notice also that velocity of the ejected fuel with respect to the inertial frame will be <m> v_x - u</m>.
		</p> -->

		
<!-- 		<p>

			Let the mass of the fuel that is ejected be <m> \Delta m</m>. The figure shows the <m> x </m> components of velocities. Equating the total momentum at <m> t </m> to total momentum <m> t + \Delta t </m> we get
			<me>
				m\, v_x = (m- \Delta m )\left( v_x + \Delta v_x \right) + (v_x - u) \Delta m.
			</me>
			This equation simplifies to:
			<me>
				m\,\Delta v_x - u\,\Delta m - \Delta m \Delta v_x = 0.
			</me>
			If we look at infintesimal time interval, the last term will become much smaller than the first term, and hence can be dropped. Now, taking the infinitesimal limit, the change   <m> \Delta v_x </m> is replaced by <m> dv_x </m> and the change in mass <m> \Delta m </m> is replaced by <m> -dm </m> since <m> dm </m> is negative.
			<me>
				m\,d v_x = - u\,d m,

			which can be written as
			<me>
				\dfrac{dv_x}{u} = -\dfrac{dm}{m}.

			Integrating this on the left from <m> v_x = v_0 </m> to <m> v_x = v_x(t) </m> and on the right from <m> m = M </m> to <m> m = m(t) </m>, we obtain the following for the final velocity of the rocket after rearranging terms.
			<me>
				v_x(t) - v_0 = u\, \ln \left( \dfrac{M}{m(t)}  \right).
			</me>
			Since we have only <m> x </m> component, the speed is simply the magnitude of <m> v_x </m>. Let <m> M_r </m> be the mass of the rocket without any fuel. Then, this equation is applicable till <m> t </m> such that <m> m(t) \le M_r </m>.

			Rocket motion is an example where the object of interest is losing mass in time, which led to the crucial minus sign when we went from <m>|\Delta m|/\Delta t</m> to <m>-dm/dt</m>. We now look at a situation in which the object of interest gains mass with time.

			 Let <m>\vec v' = \vec v + \Delta \vec v</m> be the velocity of the spacecraft at <m>t+\Delta t</m>. Then, change in momentum in this duration will be

			Simplifying we have 
			<me>
				\Delta \vec p = m\, \Delta \vec v + \Delta m\, ( \vec v - \vec u )  + \Delta m \Delta \vec v.
			</me>
 			Dividing by <m>\Delta t</m> we get

 				\frac{\Delta \vec p}{\Delta t} = m\, \frac{\Delta \vec v}{\Delta t} + \frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t}\, ( \vec v - \vec u )  + \Delta m \frac{\Delta \vec v}{\Delta t}.
 			</me>
 			(Calculus Part) Taking <m>\Delta t \rightarrow 0</m> limit will mean <m>\Delta m \rightarrow 0</m> and <m>\Delta v\rightarrow 0</m> as well. In this limit we see that the last term drops out and the other terms turn into derivatives.

 			In the absence of any force <m>\vec F=0</m>, the velocity of the spaceship will change according to

 				m\, \frac{d \vec v}{d t} = - \frac{d m}{d t}\, ( \vec v - \vec u ),

 			<men>
 				\frac{dv_x}{ v_x - u_x} = - \frac{dm}{m}.
 			</men>
 			Equation <xref ref="eq-spaceship-accretion-calculus"/> also says that if you wanted the velocity of the spaceship steady at <m>\vec v</m>, i.e., you required <m>d \vec v/dt = 0</m>, you will need a force, e.g., by rockets on the ship, of the magnitude and direction given by
 			<me>
 				\vec F =  \frac{d m}{d t}\, ( \vec v - \vec u ).
 			</me>
 			This equation is consistent with the observation that if <m>\vec u = \vec v</m>, particles will move at the same velocity as the ship and hence will never strike the ship. In that case ship does not need any force to act on it to maintain constant velocity.

<!-- 	<subsection><title> Role of Thrust</title> -->

		<!-- <p>
			In many situations of practical interest we find that the mass of the body of interest changes with time. For instance, in the motion of a rocket, the mass of the rocket decreases as burnt fuel is ejected from the rocket. Similarly, a squid can propel itself forward by squirting water back.    
		</p>
		<p>
			The momentum carried away by the ejected fuel of the rocket provides additional momentum in the opposite direction to the rest of the rocket due to conservation of momentum. In a sense, the rest of the rocket recoils just as gun recoils after a bullet is fired.
		</p>

		<p>
			These systems can accelerate even in the absence of any force contrary to the equation <m> m\vec a= \vec F</m>. For instance, a rocket can pick up speed even when shot up although gravity alone should cause the rocket to slow down. 
		</p> -->
<!-- 		<p>
			In a rocket, the impulse from ejected fuel is said to provide an inertial force, called <q> thrust</q>, which we need to include in <m>m\vec a = \vec F</m> to complete the picture.  Let us denote the thrust by <m> \vec T</m> and write our <q> modified <m>m\vec a = \vec F</m></q>.

		<p>
			Consider a rocket in gravity-free space with total mass <m> M </m> of which <m> M_f </m> be the fuel. The rocket is cruizing at constant speed of <m> v_0 </m> and  starts to fire up at <m> t = 0 </m> ejecting burnt fuel from back of the rocket till it runs out of fuel. The burnt fuel comes out from the back at a constant speed <m> u </m> with respect to the rocket. We wish to find the speed of the rocket at an arbitrary time <m> t </m> before the rocket runs out of fuel.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since there are no external forces on the (rocket <m>+</m> fuel) system, their combined momentum cannot change. Let us look at what happens during a period <m> t </m> to <m> t + \Delta t </m>. Since the motion will be along some line, we pick that line to be the <m> x </m> axis of an inertial frame. 
		</p>

		</figure>
 
		<p>
			Let <m> v_x </m> denote the <m> x  </m> component of the velocity of the rocket at instant <m> t </m> and let <m> \Delta v_x </m> be the change in it during the interval. Notice also that velocity of the ejected fuel with respect to the inertial frame will be <m> v_x - u</m>.
		</p>

		
		<p>

			Let the mass of the fuel that is ejected be <m> \Delta m</m>. The figure shows the <m> x </m> components of velocities. Equating the total momentum at <m> t </m> to total momentum <m> t + \Delta t </m> we get
			<me>
				m\, v_x = (m- \Delta m )\left( v_x + \Delta v_x \right) + (v_x - u) \Delta m.
			</me>
			This equation simplifies to:
			<me>
				m\,\Delta v_x - u\,\Delta m - \Delta m \Delta v_x = 0.
			</me>
			If we look at infintesimal time interval, the last term will become much smaller than the first term, and hence can be dropped. Now, taking the infinitesimal limit, the change   <m> \Delta v_x </m> is replaced by <m> dv_x </m> and the change in mass <m> \Delta m </m> is replaced by <m> -dm </m> since <m> dm </m> is negative.
			<me>
				m\,d v_x = - u\,d m,
			</me>
			which can be written as
			<me>
				\dfrac{dv_x}{u} = -\dfrac{dm}{m}.
			</me>
			Integrating this on the left from <m> v_x = v_0 </m> to <m> v_x = v_x(t) </m> and on the right from <m> m = M </m> to <m> m = m(t) </m>, we obtain the following for the final velocity of the rocket after rearranging terms.
			<me>
				v_x(t) - v_0 = u\, \ln \left( \dfrac{M}{m(t)}  \right).
			</me>
			Since we have only <m> x </m> component, the speed is simply the magnitude of <m> v_x </m>. Let <m> M_r </m> be the mass of the rocket without any fuel. Then, this equation is applicable till <m> t </m> such that <m> m(t) \le M_r </m>.

		<p>
			In many situations of practical interest we find that the mass of the body of interest changes with time. For instance, in the motion of a rocket, the mass of the rocket decreases as burnt fuel is ejected from the rocket. Although the total mass of the rocket and the ejected fuel is constant in this situation, we are normally interested in describing the motion of the rocket part only. Similarly, when a rain drop falls, it gathers more water and consequently its mass increases with time.  
		</p>
		<p>
			These systems are called sytems with  <term> time-varying mass </term>. They are also examples of <term>open systems</term> as opposed to <term>closed systems</term>, which refers to systems with constant mass. 
		</p>
		<p>
			These problems are handled by using the complete form of Newton's second law in terms of the change of momentum since the constant-mass formulation of Newton's second law does not even apply here. In this section, we will show how to adapt Newton's second law for systems with varying mass.  
		</p>
		<p>
			To see the special problem that arises in  systems with time-varying mass substitute <m> \vec p = m\vec v</m> in  the Newton's second law in the momentum form, and carry out the derivative with respect to time to obtain the following.
			<me>
				\vec F = \left( \dfrac{dm}{dt} \right)\, \vec v + m\, \vec a.
			</me>
			Let us rearrange the terms in this equation so that we keep <m> m\, \vec a</m> on the one side of the equation and other terms on the other side
			<men xml:id="eq-time-varying-equation-of-motion"> 
			 m\,\vec a = \vec F - \left( \frac{dm}{dt} \right)\, \vec v. 
			</men>
			The second term on the right is an inertial term that <q> acts like a force</q>.
			Thus, if mass of the system can change (i.e., if  <m> dm/dt \ne 0 </m>), then we will notice acceleration or deceleration, even when there is no force <m>(\vec F=0)</m>.  
		</p>
		<p>
			When mass is decreasing, <m> dm/dt \lt 0</m>, the inertial force would provide additional force in the direction of the velocity. This is the mechanism by which rockets gain speed when they are ejecting the burnt fuel. On the other hand, 
			when mass is accumulating, <m> dm/dt \gt 0</m>,  motion will be impeded by the inertial force.

		<statement>
			<p>
				Rocket motion near the surface of the Earth is subject to an approximately constant gravitational force of the Earth.
			</p>
			<p> Consider a rocket of initial total mass <m> M_0 </m> with <m> M_r </m> the mass of the rocket without the fuel. The rocket is rising straight up near Earth with the  fuel being ejected at a constant speed <m>u</m> with respect to the rocket and at a constant rate <m> \alpha \text{ kg/s}</m>.

				Prove that the vertical component of the velocity at time <m> t </m> will be
				<me>
					v = v_0 - gt + u\ln\left(\frac{M_0}{M_0-\alpha t}\right)
				</me>
			</p>
 

		</statement>
		<hint> <p>  Set up equation similar to the example with no external force. </p> </hint>
		<answer> <p>  Already given in the statement. </p> </answer>
		<solution> 


			<p>
				We will work with positive <m>y</m> axis pointed up. Let <m> v_y </m> denote <m> y  </m> component of the velocity of the rocket at instant <m> t </m> and let <m> \Delta v_y </m> be the change in it during an interval between <m> t </m> and <m> t + \Delta t </m>. Notice also that velocity of the ejected fuel with respect to the inertial frame will be <m> v_y - u</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, the change in momentum of the rocket plus burnt fuel combined system along the <m> y </m> axis is
				<md>
					<mrow>\Delta p_y  \amp = \left[ \Delta m ( v_y - u ) + (m - \Delta m) (v_y + \Delta v_y ) \right] - m v_y,</mrow>
					<mrow>   \amp \rightarrow  - u \Delta m   +  m \Delta v_y  \text{ (as } \Delta t \rightarrow 0\text{.)}</mrow>
				</md>
 
			</p>
			<p>
				The impulse of the external force of gravity on the rocket during the intreval is
				<me>
					J_y = - m(t) g \Delta t.
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				Using the momentum-impulse relation we get
				<me>
					m \Delta v_y - u \Delta m = - m g \Delta t.
				</me>
				Divide both sides by <m> m</m>. Now, taking the infinitesimal limit, the change   <m> \Delta v_x </m> is replaced by <m> dv_x </m> and the change in mass <m> \Delta m </m> is replaced by <m> -dm </m> since <m> dm </m> is negative. We also write <m> dm/m </m> as <m> d\ln m</m>.
			
				<me>
					 d v_y + u\, d \ln m = - g\, dt.
				</me>
				Integrating from <m> t = 0</m> to <m> t = t</m> we find
				<me>
					v_y(t) - v_y(0)  + u\,\ln\left(\frac{M_0-\alpha t}{M_0}\right) = - gt.
				</me>
				In this equation we can write <m> v_y(t) </m> as <m> v</m> and <m> v_y(0) </m> as <m> v_0</m>, and  rerarrange  to get the desired result.
				<me>
					v = v_0 - gt + u\,\ln\left(\frac{M_0}{M_0-\alpha t}\right).
