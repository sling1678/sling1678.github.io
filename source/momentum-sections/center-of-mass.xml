		<p>
			A macroscopic object such as a car or a human being has many independently moving parts. To understand their motion fully you need to study motion of each part and how they impact each other. However, all you need is the overall motion of the entire body, regardless of the changing shape due to independenly moving parts, you can follow the motion of the entire mass placed at a special mathemtical point for the entire body. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<idx>Center of Mass</idx>
			This special point is called <term>center of mass</term>. Center of mass of a body may or may not be inside the body. Below, you will learn to find the location of the center of mass in various situations. 
			<!-- Near Earth, since gravity is uniform, center of mass coincides with the center of gravity. -->
		</p>
		<!-- <p>
			To fully understand mechanics of an object that consists of many moving parts, you will need to study motion of each part. For instance, if you wanted to understand motion of a person, you will need to follow motion of arms, legs, heart, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite these complications, you can study <term>overall translational motion </term> of the entire body by replacing the entire body by a single point and placing the total mass at that point. This special point is called the <term>center of mass</term>. This mathematical point may or may not be part of the body. Below, you will learn to find the location of a center of mass. Near Earth, since gravity is uniform, center of mass coincides with the center of gravity.

			<p>
				If an object is made up of parts that are not point particles, such as a human body, then center of mass of such as object can be obtained by replacing each macroscopic part by an <q>equivalent point particle</q> with the same mass but located at the center of mass of part. Thus, we replace position vectors in Eq. <xref ref="eq-cm-position-of-n-point-masses"/> by the center of mass of each part.

	<idx><h>Center of Mass</h><h>of Continous Objects</h></idx>

		<introduction>

		<p>
			In a physical object, such as the human body, large number of discrete atoms are essentially distributed continuously. To take into account the possibility that different parts of the object may have different densities, we model a physical body by a <term> density function</term>, <m> \rho(x,y,z)</m>, which is local density at position <m>(x,y,z)</m>. An integral over the volume of the object gives the mass, <m> M </m>
			<men xml:id="eq-cm-continupius-object-mass">
				M = \iiint\, \rho(x,y,z)\, dxdydz
			</men>
			The center of mass can then be stated as the following integral.
			<men xml:id="eq-cm-continupius-object-rcm">
				\vec R_\text{cm} = \dfrac{1}{M}\, \iiint\,\vec r\, \rho(x,y,z)\, dxdydz,
			</men>
			where <m>\vec r = x \hat i + y \hat j + z \hat k </m>.			
		</p>
		<!-- <p>
			To locate the center of mass of a continuous body, we first discretize the body by conceptually <q> breaking it up into small cells</q>, and then, replace each cell by its mass <m> \Delta m </m>.  This process converts the original continuous body into an equivalent system of point masses to which we can apply the formula for the CM of discrete masses given in <xref ref="eq-cm-position"/>.  Making the sizes of these cells infinitely small coverts the sums into integrals. 
			<men>
					\vec R_{\text{CM}} = \dfrac{1}{M}\, \int\int\int\, \vec r \, \rho(x,y,z)\, dxdydz,

		<sidebyside widths="60% 5% 35%">
			<p>
				We often write the integral in a more conceptual form by denoting <m> \rho(x,y,z)\, dxdydz </m> by <m> dm </m>, which stands for a small mass at  the infintesimal cubical cell located center at <m> (x,y,z) </m>.

		<p>
			The first step in calculating integral in Eq. <xref ref="eq-cm-position-continuous"/> involves picking a representative infinitesimal element of the body guided by the symmetry of the body. Then, <m>dm</m> can be cast into an integral that you can often do without much difficulty. The three steps of calculation of CM are illustrated for a cone in <xref ref="fig-cm-calculation-illustration-cone"/>.

		<p>
			Although Eq. <xref ref="eq-cm-position-continuous"/>  is applicable to all systems, most of the time we will be working with regular solids of uniform density. In these situations, the density function <m> \rho(x,y,z) = \rho_0</m>, the uniform density, comes out of integrals for <m>M</m> and <m>\vec R_\text{CM}</m> and cancels out.
			<men>
				\vec R_{\text{CM}} = \dfrac{1}{V}\,\iiint \vec r \, dxdydz;\ \ V = \iiint dxdydz,
			</men>
			where integrals are taken over the space occupied by the body. The integral over <m>\vec r</m> locates the geometric centroid of the body. Thus, if a body has some symmetry, you do not need to do any integral since you can often locate the geometric centroid just by inspection.				
		</p>
		<p>
			 Thus, CM can sometimes be <em> guessed  by symmetry</em>. For instance, the center of mass of a spherical object will be at the center, the center of mass of a box will be at the center of the box, etc.  <xref ref="fig-centers-of-mass-solids"/> shows the centers of a sphere, a cylinder, and a triangular shaped object of uniform density.

			xml:id="ex-Change-in-the-Center-of-Mass-of-Human-Body-with-Movement-of-Arms"><title> Change in the Center of Mass of Human Body with Movement of Arms </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose you weigh <m>90\text{ kg}</m> and your arm weighs <m> 10\text{ kg}</m> each. Suppose  the center of mass of your arms is <m>18\text{ cm}</m> from your shoulder.  How much will your center of mass rise if you lift your arm from both down to both fully up and extended as shown in <xref ref="fig-change-in-cm-of-human-body-lifting-arm"/>.

			<hint> <p> Set up equations for the center of mass in the vertical direction in the two ssituations. Choosing origin  at the center of mass when arms down may be helpful also. </p> </hint>
			<answer> <p> <m> 12\text{ cm}</m>.  </p> </answer>
			<solution> 
				<p>
					Let us choose <m>y</m> axis pointed up with origin at the center of mass when the arms are down. Let <m>y_0</m> be the <m>y</m>-coordinate of the arms when they are down and <m>Y</m> be the <m>y</m> coordinate of the rest of the body. Let <m>M</m> denote your entire mass and <m>m</m> the mass of each arm.

					<image source="./images/momentum/change-in-cm-of-human-body-lifting-arm-solution.png" width="60%"/>
				</figure>
				<p>
					Since in my construction, <m>y</m> coordinate of the CM is zero when arms are down, from the left side of  <xref ref="fig-change-in-cm-of-human-body-lifting-arm-solution"/>, we will get
					<me>
						M\,y_\text{cm} = 2\, m\, y_0 + (M-2m_0)\, Y,
					</me>
					which is zero on the left side, giving
					<men xml:id="eq-cm-when-hands-down">
						2\, m\, y_0 + (M-2m_0)\, Y = 0.
					</men>
					Let <m> h </m> be the <m>y</m> coordinate of the CM when the arms are up and <m> y_1</m> the <m>y</m> coordinate of the arms when they are up. Then, the right side of <xref ref="fig-change-in-cm-of-human-body-lifting-arm-solution"/> will give
					<men  xml:id="eq-cm-when-hands-up">
						M\,h = 2\, m\, y_1 + (M-2m_0)\, Y.
					</men>
					Subtracting Eq. <xref ref="eq-cm-when-hands-down"/> from  Eq. <xref ref="eq-cm-when-hands-up"/>, we get
					<me>
						M\, h = 2\, m\, \left(  y_1 - y_0 \right).
					</me>
					Note that <m>y_1-y_0</m> is twice the distance of the CM of the arm from the shoulder. Let us denote the distance of the CM of the arms from the shoulder by <m>d</m>. Solving for <m>h</m> we get
					<me>
						h = \dfrac{4\, m}{M}\, d = \dfrac{4\times 15}{90}\times 18 = 12\text{ cm}.

		<statement>
			<p>
				Density of material of a rod of uniform cross-section varies along its length. Let <m>x=0</m> at one end and <m>x=L</m> at the other end. Then, density <m>\rho(x) = \lambda_0\;(x/a)^2</m>, where <m>\lambda_0</m> and <m>a</m> are constants. Find the location from the CM.

			<m>\frac{3 L}{4}</m>.
		</p></answer>
		<solution>
			<p>
				Let <m>A</m> be the area of cross-section. Consider an element between <m>x</m> and <m>x+dx</m>. The <m>X_\text{cm}</m> will be
				<men xml:id="eq-Rod-of-Varying-Density-1">
					MX_\text{cm} = \int x dm.
				</men>
				Here,
				<me>
					dm = \rho A dx =  \lambda_0\;(x/a)^2 A dx.
				</me>
				Therefore, total mass will be
				<me>
					M = \int dm = \int_0^L  \lambda_0\;(x/a)^2 A dx = \frac{\lambda_0}{3a^2}\; A L^3.
				</me>
				Using this and <m>dm</m> in Eq. <xref ref="eq-Rod-of-Varying-Density-1"/>, we get
				<md>
					<mrow> X_\text{cm} \amp = \frac{1}{M}\;\int x dm</mrow>
					<mrow>   \amp = \frac{3a^2}{\lambda_0 A L^3}\;\int_0^L \lambda_0\;(x/a)^2 A x dx</mrow>
					<mrow>   \amp = \frac{3a^2}{\lambda_0 A L^3}\; \frac{\lambda_0}{4a^2} AL^4 = \frac{3 L}{4}. </mrow>
