			As an illustration of collision, consider hanging two pendula next to each other as shown in <xref ref="fig-collision-two-pendula"/>. After you let go of the pendulum, say an instant before (a) in the figure, ball 1 accelerates under the influence of external forces of weight (<m>m_1 g</m>) and tension (<m>T_1</m>).

		<p>
			An instant before the collision, ball 1 has momentum <m>\vec p_1 = p_{1x}\hat i</m> and ball 2 has zero momentum, <m>\vec p_2 = 0</m>. The collision is the process in which the two balls push into each other and change each other's momenta. After the collision, the momenta of the two balls will be <m>\vec p^\prime_1 = p^\prime_{1x}\hat i</m> and <m>\vec p^\prime_2 = p^\prime_{12}\hat i</m>. The collision process lasts for a very short period of time. During this interval, <m>\Delta t</m>, impulse by the external forces will be nearly zero. Therefore, we will find that the total momenta of the two balls will be unchanged during the collision.
			<men xml:id="eq-collision-momentum-conservation-0">
				\vec p_1 + \vec p_2 = \vec p^\prime_1 + \vec p^\prime_2.
			</men>
			Here, only <m>x</m> components are involved and this will give one analytic equation.
			<me>
				p_{1x} + p_{2x} = p^\prime_{1x} + p^\prime_{2x}.
			</me>
			In Eq. <xref ref="eq-collision-momentum-conservation-0"/>, often we use subscript <m>i</m> for before collision and <m>f</m> for after collision momenta rather than unprime and prime symbols. Thus, <m> \vec p_{1i} </m> and <m> \vec p_{2i} </m> will be the momenta of two colliding balls an instant before the collision, and <m> \vec p_{1f} </m> and <m> \vec p_{2f} </m> be their momenta an instant after the collision<!-- , as shown in <xref ref="fig-two-body-collision" /> then -->. In a collision process we must have
			<men xml:id="eq-collision-momentum-conservation">
				\vec p_{1i} + \vec p_{2i} = \vec p_{1f} + \vec p_{2f}.
			</men>
<!-- 		</p>

		<p>
			Therefore, during a collision,  a transfer of momentum between the bodies takes place such that the total momentum of bodies before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.  Both the direction and the magnitude of the momenta of the two colliding objects may change, subject to the constraint that the total momentum remains fixed at the value immediately prior to the collision.

			<xref ref="fig-collision-momnetum-vectors-before-after"/> shows relations of momentum vectors before collision and after collision. The total moementum vector before the collision is the same vector as after the collision. Therefore, if total momentum vector before the collision falls in <m>xy</m>-plane, it will be also in the <m>xy</m>-plane after the collision. You can illustrate that if three of the four momentum vectors shown in the figure falls in <m>xy</m>-plane, the fourth one must also be in <m>xy</m>-plane.

				We denote the <m> x </m> component of the unknown velocity by <m>  v_{2x}^\prime</m>. The conservation of momentum along the <m> x </m> axis gives the following equation, where the left side is the before and the right side the after.

				We need to find the magnitude and direction of the velocity <m> \vec v_{B,f}</m>. For brevity, let us denote the components of this velocity by <m> (v_x,\, v_y) </m>.

				We now <alert> interpret </alert> the direction from this angle and the quadrant of <m> (v_x, v_y)</m>. Since 	<m> (-12.1,\, -2.3)</m> is in the third quadrant, the direction is <m> 10.8^{\circ}</m> counterclockwise from the negative <m> x </m> axis.

		<p>
			A collision is said to be <term>elastic</term> if, in addition to the conservation of momentum, kinetic energy is also conserved. Kinetic energy of a particle of mass <m> m</m> and speed <m>v</m> is defined by
			<me>
				KE = \dfrac{1}{2} m v^2.
			</me>
			This can also be written as <m>p^2/2m</m> by using magnitude of momentum as <m>p=mv</m>. 
			We say that a collision is a a <term>head-on collision</term> if momenta before and after collision are along one line as illustrated in <xref ref="fig-elastic-collision-head-on"/>.

			In a head-on collision momentum conservation will produce one equation along the axis of the momenta. If the collision is elastic, we will also have an equation for the conservation of kinetic energy. Refering to the quantities shown in <xref ref="fig-elastic-collision-head-on"/> we will have

				The breaking up process is reverse of sticking together process. In both situations, we have only the internal forces. Therefore, momentum is conserved.

					Since the momentum conservation is a vector equation, we can choose axes to simplify that equation. 
					Here, if we choose positive <m>x</m>-axis to point in the forward direction, as shown in the figure below, we need to work with only <m>x</m>-components.

				We will use conservation of momentum with in the frame of the table. Therefore, we need to express all velocities with respect to the table.

				The explosion involves only internal forces between the two resulting pieces. Therefore, total momentum is conserved. But, we need to make sure we express all momenta with respect to the same reference, which we will take to be ground.

		<answer><p>
			<m>u=550\text{ m/s}</m>, <m>V=238\text{ m/s}</m>.
		</p></answer>
		<solution>
			<p>
				Using <xref ref="fig-two-dim-explosion-point3-point7M"/> we can write conservation of momentum along <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axis. 
				<mdn>
					<mrow xml:id="eq-two-dim-explosion-point3-point7M-1">\amp 0.8 M V \cos\theta - 0.2 M u \cos\phi = M v_0. </mrow>
					<mrow  xml:id="eq-two-dim-explosion-point3-point7M-2">\amp 0.8 M V \sin\theta - 0.2 M u \sin\phi = 0. </mrow>
				</mdn>
				From the second equation, we get
				<me>
					V = \frac{1}{4}\,u\,\frac{\sin\phi}{\sin\theta} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\,u.
				</me>
				Using this in Eq. <xref ref="eq-two-dim-explosion-point3-point7M-2"/> gives
				<me>
					0.8\times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\,u\,\cos\theta - 0.2\,\,\cos\phi = v_0.
				</me>
				Solving this for <m>u</m>, we get
				<me>
					u = 5 v_0 = 550\text{ m/s}.
				</me>
				Therefore,
				<me>
					V = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{4}v_0 = 238\text{ m/s}.

(b) Prove that in the limit <m>a\rightarrow \infty</m>, the collision will be elastic.
			</p>
		</statement>
		<hint><p>
			(a) Only momentum is conserved.
		</p></hint>
		<answer><p>
			(a) <m>\frac{10}{a}\text{ m/s}</m>.
		</p></answer>
		<solution><title>(a)</title>
			<p>
				Let <m>v</m> be the speed of the second block after collision. Using <m>x</m>-axis along the direction of motion, we get
				<md>
					<mrow>\amp x\text{-momentum: } m \times 5 = m \times (-5) + a m v. </mrow>
				</md>
				This gives
				<me>
					v = \frac{10}{a}.
				</me>
			</p>
		</solution>
		<solution><title>(b)</title>
			<p>
				Let us find the difference in kinetic energy.
				<md>
					<mrow>\Delta\,KE \amp = \left[ \frac{1}{2} (am) \left( \frac{10}{a}\right)^2 + \frac{1}{2}m \times 5^2 \right] - \frac{1}{2}m \times 5^2  </mrow>
					<mrow> \amp =  \frac{50\,m}{a}. </mrow>
				</md>
				This will be zero as <m>a\rightarrow \infty</m>. Therefore, kinetic energy will be also consered in this limit, which will mean that for the first block to bounce back with the same speed, the collision will be elastic if the second block has infinite mass.
