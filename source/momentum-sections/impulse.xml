				When you hit a baseball, you change direction and magnitue of the momentum of the ball in a very short duration of time. The change in momentum is caused by the force from the bat acting on the ball during the time they were in contact with each other.

				If you look at the magnitude of the force on the ball, it will be initially zero till contact occurs, will increase as the bat crushes into the ball, and then, will decrease to zero as the ball leaves the bat. The stronger the force and/or the longer the force acts on the ball, the greater the change in the momentum of the ball.

			That is, both the magnitude of the force and the time are important for causing a change in momentum. For this purpose, we define <term>impulse</term>, <m>\vec J</m>, during an infintesimal interval <m>\Delta t</m> by product of the force <m>\vec F</m> and the interval.

			 If force is changing with time, as for example the force shown in <xref ref="fig-force-of-impulse"/>, we will need to integrate  <m>\vec F(t)</m> with respect to time <m>t</m>, or, work with area under the curve of the components of force versus time. Thus, impulse is formally defined by the following <q>conceptual integral</q>
			 <men xml:id="eq-impulse-fundamental-definition">
			 	\vec J = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\vec F(t) \;dt\ \ \ (\text{Calculus/Formal Defintion}).

			 The Cartesian components of impulse will be integrals that you can perform from given funtions <m>F_x(t)</m>, <m>F_y(t)</m>, <m>F_z(t)</m>.
			 <men xml:id="eq-impulse-fundamental-definition-components-analytic">
			 	J_i = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\vec F_i(t) \;dt\ \ \ (i = x, y, z).
			 </men>
			 Previously, we have seen that another way to look at integrals is <q>area under the curve</q>. Thus, <m>J_x</m> during interval <m>t_1\le t \le t_2</m> will be area between <m>F_x(t)</m> and <m>F_x=0</m> when you plot <m>F_x</m> versus <m>t</m>.

			</men>
			From the components <m>(J_x, J_y, J_z)</m>, we can obtain the mangitude and direction of impulse as we do for any other vector quantity.

<!-- 		<p>
			It turns out that the area under the <m> F </m> versus <m> t </m> plot determines the change in momentum.

					If force is constant, then, the area will simply be a product of the force and duration. Say, force has a constant magnitude <m> F_0</m> and acts for a duration <m> T</m> in the same direction. Then, impulse of this force will be

<!-- 		<p>
			The area under the curve of the magnitude of force gives only the magnitude of the impulse. Just as force is a vector, the impulse is also a vector. Equation, <xref ref="eq-impulse-as-area-under-the-curve" /> will work correctly to give the direction of the impulse vector from the direction of the force vector <em>if direction of the force vector does not change in the duration when the force acts</em>. Therefore, 

			<men xml:id="eq-impulse-as-area-under-the-curve-vector">
				\vec J = \begin{cases}
					\amp \text{Magnitude: the area under }F \text{ vs }t\text{ plot.}\\
					\amp \text{Direction: same as force if direction of force constant.}
					\end{cases}
			</men>
		</p>
		<p>
			How do we get both magnitude and direction of a force whose direction changes during the time it is acting on the body? This is usually not the case for most aplications of impulse. But, nonetheless, we should cover this possibility as well. A good way to handle this situation is to think in terms of components: obtain <m> J_x </m> from <m> F_x \text{ vs } t</m>, <m> J_y </m> from <m> F_y \text{ vs } t</m>, and <m> J_z </m> from <m> F_z \text{ vs } t</m>. Then, find the magnitue and direction of the impulse vector.

			</mdn>
			Recall that the force components, <m> F_x</m>, <m> F_y</m>, and <m> F_z</m> can be positive or negative depending upon the direction of the force vector, <m> \vec F = (F_x, F_y, F_z)</m>, the corresponding impulses <m> J_x</m>, <m> J_y</m>, and <m> J_z</m> will also e positive or negative. However, when you compute the magnitude from the Pythagora's formula, you will always get a positive value.

		<p> 
			Consider an interval <m> t=t_i</m> to <m> t=t_f</m> during which we wish to compute the impulse of a force <m> \vec F </m>, whose  direction is fixed in time, for simplicity. Here, we will show how the formula for the magnitude of impulse is derived.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let us divide the interval into <m> N </m> subintervals: <m> 
			(t_0=t_i, t_1)</m>, <m> (t_1, t_2)</m>, <m> (t_2, t_3)</m>, <m> \cdots</m>, <m> (t_{N-2}, t_{N-1})</m>, and <m> (t_{N-1}, t_N=t_f)</m>. For simplicity, let the intervals be of equal length in time, <m> \Delta t</m>,
			<me>
				\Delta t = \dfrac{t_f - t_i}{N}.
			</me>
		</p>

		<figure xml:id="fig-impulse-calculus-derivation-subintervals">
			<caption> The impulse of a force over an interval <m> (t_i, t_f) </m> can be computed by dividing the interval into a large number of subintrevals, computing the magnitude of impulses for each subinterval, and then adding them up. During the subinterval <m> (t_{k-1}, t_{k}) </m>, the magnitude of force at the ends of the interval are <m> F_{k-1} </m> and <m> F_{k}</m> respectively, whose average is denoted by <m>F_{k}^{\text{av}}</m>.
			</caption>
			<image source="./images/momentum/impulse-calculus-derivation-subintervals.png" width="90%" /> 
		</figure>
		
		<p>
			Now, let us compute the impulse magnitude <m> J_k</m> in the <m>k^{\text{th}}</m> subinterval. Let the magnitude of the force at the ends of this subinterval be <m> F_{k-1} </m> and <m> F_{k} </m>. If <m> N </m> is large enough, then <m>F_{k-1} </m> and <m> F_{k} </m> will be almost the same, and therefore, we can get a good approximation of impulse magnitude <m> J_k</m> by using the average force in the subinterval as
			<me>
				J_k \approx F_{k}^{\text{av}}\, \Delta t
			</me>
			We now add up impulses from every subinterval to get the impulse over the original interval.
			<me>
				J \approx \sum_{k=1}^{N} \, F_{k}^{\text{av}}\, \Delta t.
			</me>
			By increasing <m> N </m> as large as we like, we can make this aproximation as accurate as we are happy with. The limit <m> N \rightarrow \infty </m> is said to be the exact value, which is represented by the integral sign.
			<men xml:id="impulse-definition-calculus">
				J  = \int_{t_i}^{t_f}\, F(t) dt.
			</men>
			If we are dealing with a force whose magnitude as well as direction changes, then we will work with one component at a time. The same procedure as above will give us the components of the impulse vector.

				<mrow> \amp J_z = \int_{t_i}^{t_f}\, F_z(t) dt.</mrow>
			</mdn>
			From <m>(J_x, J_y, J_z)</m> you can compute the magnitude and direction of the impulse in a usual way.
			<!-- Furthermore, if the direction of <m> \vec F </m> does not change during the interval of interest, you could just use that direction as one of the Cartesian axes. Then, clearly, we can state the magnitude of the impulse as
