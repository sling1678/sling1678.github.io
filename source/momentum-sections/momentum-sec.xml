	<idx>Momentum</idx>
		<p>
			The product of mass (<m>m</m>) and velocity (<m>\vec v</m>) is called <term> momentum </term>. We denote momentum vector by <m> \vec p </m> and the magnitude by the same letter without <m>p</m>  the arrow.
			<men xml:id="eq-momentum-definition-fundamental">
				\vec p = m\, \vec v.
			</men>
		</p>
		<p>
			Momentum is a vector, just like velocity is a vector. The magnitude of momentum, denoted by the same symbol but without the overhead arrow, viz., <m> p</m>, is obtained by multiplying the mass and speed <m> v</m>, and the direction of momentum is same as the direction of velocity.
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp \text{Magnitude, } p = m\, v,</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \text{Direction of } \vec p  \text{ is same as the direction of } \vec v. </mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also think of mementum in terms of its Cartesian components, similar to other vectors. Thus, <m> x </m>, <m> y </m> and <m> z </m> components of momentum will be equal to the product of mass and corresponding component of the velocity vector.
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp p_x = m\, v_x,</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp p_y = m\, v_y,</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp p_z = m\, v_z.</mrow>

		<statement>
			<p>
				A car of mass <m> 3000\text{ kg}</m> is moving to the East at a speed of <m> 3\text{ m/s}</m>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				(a)  How much momentum does the car have?
			</p>
			<p>
				(b) If you ride your motorcycle, with what speed must you ride to equal the same momentum? Assume motorcycle plus your mass is <m>300\text{ kg}</m>.
			</p>
		</statement>
		<!-- <hint> <p> (a) Use <m> p = mv </m>, (b) Use computed momentum. </p> </hint> -->
		<answer><p> (a) <m> 9,000 \text{ kg.m/s} </m>, East, (b) <m> 30\text{ m/s}</m>, East.</p> </answer>
		<solution><title>a</title>
			<p> 
				
				It would be a mistake to just multiply mass with the speed and report that as the momentum <alert> since momentum is a vector quantity </alert>. Therefore, we must indicate both the magnitude and direction in our answer.
				<md>
					<mrow> \amp\text{Magnitude } =  mv = (3000\ \text{ kg}) \times (3\ \text{ m/s}) = 9,000 \text{ kg.m/s}.</mrow>
					<mrow> \amp\text{Direction: Towards East.} </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</solution>
		<solution><title> b </title>
			<p>
				
				Since mass is <m>10 \times</m> less, you will need to ride at speed <m>10 \times</m> greater to have the same magnitude of momentum.
				<me>
					v = 10\times 3 = 30\text{ m/s}.
				</me>
				You could also set up an equation.
				<me>
					m_\text{mc}v_\text{mc} = m_\text{car}v_\text{car}.
				</me>
				Of course, your direction will also have to match that of the car for the momentum to be truly equal.

			Since velocity is defined relative to an observer, <alert> momentum is also relative to an observer</alert>. For instance, say, you and your friend are sitting in a train which is moving with respect to a ground-based observer. Then, your friend's momentum with respect to you will be zero but non-zero with respect to the ground-based observer.

				<p>
					In <xref ref="fig-example-Momentum-of-a-Cannon-Ball-Fired-From-a-Boat-on-a-River"/> we have <m>y</m>-axis to the North. Therefore, the velocity of the boat with respect to the shore is
					<me>
						\vec V = 10\,\hat j.
					</me>
					Now, we add this to the velocity of the ball with respect to the boat to get the velocity of the ball with respet to the shore. Let us denote this velocity with <m>\vec w</m>.
					<me>
						\vec w = \vec V + \vec v = 40\,\cos\,30^\circ \hat i + 10\,\hat j + 40\,\sin\,30^\circ \hat k.
					</me>
					From this we get momentum of the cannon ball with respect to the shore to be
					<me>
						m \vec w = 800\,\cos\,30^\circ \hat i + 200\,\hat j + 800\,\sin\,30^\circ \hat k.
					</me>
					You can get the magnitude by
					<me>
						\sqrt{800^2\cos^2\,30^\circ + 200^2 + 800^2\sin^2\,30^\circ} = 825\text{ kg.m/s}.

			Note that the sum of the momenta is a vector sum and one must be careful not to just add the magnitudes of the momenta since directions are equally important.

			Another aspect of adding momenta is to note that the momenta on the right side of formula in Eq. <xref ref="eq-total-monentum-of-parts"/> are all with respect to the same reference point.
