			<solution> 
				<p>
					We use positive <m> y </m> coordinate pointed up with origin at the ground. Since only external force on the two blocks is the gravity, we have a free-fall motion of the center of mass. This will give the following equation for the <m> Y_\text{cm}</m> at instant <m> t </m>.

					Let <m> v_0</m> be the initial speed and <m>\theta</m> the initial direction. Let the projetile 1 be initially located at the origin and the positive <m> x </m> axis be towards projectile 2. his gives us the following for the constant <m>x</m> velocities of the two projectiles.

					After they collide, let <m> V_x</m> be the <m>x</m> component of the velocity of the two together. Conservation of momentum along the <m> x </m> axis gives us
					<me>
						V_x = \dfrac{ m_1 v_{1i,x} + m_2 v_{2i,x}}{m_1 + m_2} = \dfrac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\, v_{1i,x}.

				<p><alert>The projectile motion part.</alert>
					If we know the height at which this projectile starts, we can figure out the place it will land. To find the height we note that during the time 1 moved a distance <m> D/2</m>, the max height <m>H</m> was reached, where <m>v_{1y}=0</m>. That is,
					<me>
						0 = v_{1i,y}^2 -2gH, \text{ where } v_{1i,y} = v_0\sin\, \theta.
					</me>
					This gives
					<me>
						H = \dfrac{v_0^2\sin^2\, \theta}{2g}.
					</me>
					Now, we can use <m>V_x</m> and <m> H</m> to get the final point <m> (x, 0)</m> from starting place, which is at <m> x_i=D/2</m> and <m>y_i=H</m> of the combined projectile. We get <m>t</m> from the <m>y</m> equation,
					<me>
						H = \dfrac{1}{2}gt^2,
					</me> 
					which gives
					<me>
						t = \sqrt{\dfrac{2H}{g}}.

					Using this in the <m> x </m> equation gives the final <m>x</m> coordinate.
					<me>
						x - \dfrac{D}{2} = V_x t = \dfrac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2}\, v_{1i,x}\, \times  \sqrt{\dfrac{2H}{g}}.
					</me>
					Now we use <m> v_{1i,x}</m> and <m>H</m> and simplify the resulting expression. We get
					<me>
						x - \dfrac{D}{2} = \left(\dfrac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right)\dfrac{v_0^2\sin\,\theta\cos\,\theta}{g}.

Actually, their combination <m> v_0^2\sin\,\theta\cos\,\theta</m> is related to the range <m>D</m> of the original projectiles, since from the symmetry we can tell that if we had launched only projectile 1, it would land at a distance <m>D</m> where the second site is located. Working out the range gives us (this is another projectile motion problem that you would need to work out.)

					<me>
						(v_y+\Delta v_y) \lambda L - v_y \lambda L = \lambda y g \Delta t.
					</me>
					Here <m>v_y = dy/dt</m>, which is equal to <m>v</m> in the figure. Dividing by <m>\Delta t</m> and taking the infinitesimal time limit, we get

					This is same as

					The general solution of this differential equation is
					<me>
						y = A e^{\sqrt{g/L}\,t} + B e^{-\sqrt{g/L}\,t},

					<me>
						v_y = \sqrt{g/L}\, \left( A e^{\sqrt{g/L}\,t} - B e^{-\sqrt{g/L}\,t} \right).

						A can is placed in an inverted position on a steady stream of water coming out a hose vertically (<xref ref="fig-water-hose-and-can-problem"/>). Initially, the can is pushed up, but at some height the can becomes suspended in air. Suppose speed of water at the hose is <m>v_0</m> in <m>\text{m/s}</m>, <m>V</m> <m>\text{kg/m}^3</m> of water flow per second, <m>\rho</m> the density of water in <m>\text{kg/m}^3</m>, and <m>M</m> the mass of the can in <m>\text{kg}</m>. What will be the height if we assume that after hitting the can, water hits the can elastically, i.e., water is turned back at the same speed? (Adapted from Kleppner and Kolenkow)

			</p></answer>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Strategy: By looking at the rate of change of momentum of water, we will get the force exerted by the can on water. By third law, water will be exerting the same magnitude force on the can. Then, we will balance forces on the can to find the necessary condition for the problem.
				</p>
				<p> 
					 Impulse on water by the can will equal the rate at which momentum of water is changed by hitting the can. Let <m>m</m> denote the mass of water that strikes the can in duration <m>\Delta t</m>. Let <m>F</m> be the magnitude of force between can and water.  Let positive <m>y</m>-axis be pointed up in <xref ref="fig-water-hose-and-can-problem"/>.
					<me>
						-F \Delta t =  m (-v) - m v = - 2 mv.
					</me>
					Here <m>v</m> is the speed with which water hits the can. Since water had vertical velocity <m>v_0</m> a height <m>h</m> below the can, we have
					<me>
						v = \sqrt{v_0^2 - 2 g h}.
					</me>
					And <m>m</m> will be
					<me>
						m = \rho V \Delta t.
					</me>
					Therefore, the magnitude of force by water on the can will be
					<me>
						F = 2\rho V \sqrt{v_0^2 - 2 g h}.
					</me>
					Now, this force balances the weight of the can to keep the can suspended. Therefore,
					<me>
						2\rho V \sqrt{v_0^2 - 2 g h} = Mg.
					</me>
					Therefore,
					<me>
						h = \frac{1}{2g}\left[ v_0^2 - \left( \frac{Mg}{2\rho V}\right)^2   \right].
					</me>
