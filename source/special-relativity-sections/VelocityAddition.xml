	<introduction>

		<p>
			We can find relation between velocity of a particle in S and S' frames by using Lorentz transformations. As before, let frame S' be moving at constant speed <m>V</m> towards positive <m>x</m> axis with respect to frame S. Then, we have
			<md>
				<mrow>\amp t = \gamma \left( t' + \frac{V}{c^2} x'  \right)</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp x = \gamma \left( x' + V t'  \right)</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp y = y',\ \ z = z'. </mrow>
			</md>
			From these we will get the followinfg for small intervals.
			<md>
				<mrow>\amp dt = \gamma \left( dt' + \frac{V}{c^2} dx'  \right)</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp dx = \gamma \left( dx' + V dt'  \right)</mrow>
				<mrow>\amp dy = dy',\ \ dz = dz'. </mrow>
			</md>			
			Therefore <m>x</m>-component of velocity in S is
			<md>
				<mrow> v_x \amp = \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{dx' + V dt'  }{dt' + \frac{V}{c^2} dx'} = \frac{dx'/dt' + V  }{1 + \frac{V}{c^2} dx'/dt'}= \frac{v'_x + V  }{1 + \frac{V}{c^2} v'_x},</mrow>
			</md>
			where I replaced <m>dx'/dt'</m> by <m>v'_x</m>, which is the <m>x</m>-component of velocity in S' frame.
			We can work out <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> components similarly.
			<md>
				<mrow> v_y \amp = \frac{dy}{dt} =  =\frac{dy' }{ \gamma\left(dt' + \frac{V}{c^2} dx'\right) } =  \frac{v'_y /\gamma}{1 + \frac{V}{c^2} v'_x}</mrow>
				<mrow> v_z\amp =  \frac{v'_z/\gamma }{1 + \frac{V}{c^2} v'_x}</mrow>
			</md>
			To summarize, we found that
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp v_x  = \dfrac{v_x^{\prime} + V}{1 + V v_x^{\prime}/c^2},</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp v_y = \dfrac{v_y^{\prime}/\gamma}{1 + V v_x^{\prime}/c^2},</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp v_z = \dfrac{v_z^{\prime}/\gamma}{1 + V v_x^{\prime}/c^2}.</mrow>
			</md>
			This is the velocity addition law that replaces the Galilean velocity addition laws, <m>v_x = v_x^{\prime} +V</m>, <m>v_y = v_y^{\prime}</m>, and <m>v_z = v_z^{\prime}</m>. We see that when the relative velocity of the frames is much smaller than the speed of light, i.e., when <m>V \lt c</m>, the special relativity velocity addition law reduces to the Galilean velocity law.

		<statement>
			<p>
				A spaceship moving at a speed of <m>0.99\:c</m> with respect to Earth sends light beam in the forward direction.  The light beam travels with speed <m>c</m> with respect to the spaceship.  What will be the speed of the beam as observed by an observer on Earth?

		<answer><p>
			<m>c</m>.
		</p></answer>
		<solution>
			<p>
				We really need no formula to answer this question. Speed of light is same in all frames regardless of the state of motion. Let us check if this is borne out by the velocity addition formulas of this section. Let positive <m>x</m>-axis be pointed towards the forward direction of the spaceship.  Then, we need to add
				<me>
					V = 0.99\:c\ \ \text{and}\ \ v^{\prime}_x = c.
				</me>
				Using the velocity addition formula we get the speed of light with respect to the Earth-based observer
				<me>
					v_x  = \dfrac{v_x^{\prime} + V}{1 + V v_x^{\prime}/c^2} = \dfrac{c + 0.99\:c}{1 + 0.99} = c.

				 Two spaceships are on a collision course moving perpendicularly to the same point as observed by an observer at rest with respect to the meeting point.

					<mrow>\amp \vec v_{AO} =  0.9 c\, \hat i.</mrow>

				<md>
					<mrow> \amp v{AB,x} = \frac{ v_{OB,x} + v_{AO,x} }{ 1 +  v_{OB,x} v_{AO,x}/c^2 } = 0.9 c.</mrow>
