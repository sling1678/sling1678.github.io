<title>Impulse and Momentum</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			Impulse and momentum provide another way to study change in motion over time. They are specially useful in situations where change occurs over a short duration such as during a collision or upon an impact or during varying mass. In many respect, these concepts provide a more complete picture of dynamics than you learn by applying <m>\vec F = m \vec a</m>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In this chapter, you will learn momentum techinques systematically, including integral form of Newton's second law of motion, the concept of center of mass, and principle of conservation of momentum.
