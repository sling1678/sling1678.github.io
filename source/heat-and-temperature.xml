    <title>Heat and Temperature</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            Heating an object leads to flow of energy called heat. Heating of a body leads to change in properties of the body, such as temperature. We study change in a body using the concept of thermodynamic state and thermodynamic equilibrium.

            What happens when you heat water in pan? The water molecules move faster as temperature rises. If we could know the position and velocity of every water molecule, we could track the mechanical state of water in the pan.

            In thermodynamics we study phenomena associated with heating and cooling. When you heat an object you increase the mechnical energy of its atoms and molecules. 



            In <term> statistical mechanics</term> we attempt to obtain explanations of thermal phenomena from the average behavior of large number of constituent particles. 


            The mechanical view would require understanding these phenomena from the motions of each atom and molecule in the body. The branch of physics, called <term> statistical mechanics</term>, attempts to obtain explanations of thermal phenomena from the average behavior of large number of constituent particles.

        	A macroscopic object contains a large number of atoms and molecules whose motions and interactions give rise to the macroscopically observable properties such as pressure, volume, and temperature.  Thermodynamics provides a complete study of the macroscopic properties of a system, primarily based on two laws, viz. the conservation of energy and the irreversible nature of thermal processes. 
        </p> 
        <p>
    		In principle, it is possible to obtain macroscopic properties from the mechanics of the constituent particles of the system.  The subjects of statistical mechanics and kinetic theory provide an explanation of the macroscopic thermodynamic properties based on the properties of the microscopic particles of the system.  In the thermodynamics part of the book, you will be learning mostly the macroscopic point of view.
