		<p>
			Expansion and contractions are important consequences of change in temperature of a body. It is important to study the thermal expansion and contraction properties of materials in order to design mechanical devices that will provide the desired performance in a given range of temperature.  In this chapter we will study how to characterize thermal expansion and mechanical stress that results in a confined material.
