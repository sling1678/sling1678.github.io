    <title>Second Law of Thermodynamics</title>

    <p>
    	First law of thermodynamics is about conservation of energy. The energy of a body can change by work and/or heat. The first law does not address if there is any restriction on the direction of flow of energy between two bodies. Turns out that there is no restriction in the direction of energy flow if the flow occurs through work, but there is a natural direction of the flow of energy by heat. This issue is addressed by the second law of thermodynamics.
