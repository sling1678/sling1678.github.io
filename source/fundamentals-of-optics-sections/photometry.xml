	<introduction>
        <p>
        	Radiometry gives us the objective measure of energy and power of light sources.  However, human eye does not respond to all colors of light equally, and we perceive intensities differently than an objective instrument.  For instance, experiments have shown that the eye is most sensitive to the yellow-green light than to the red and blue lights of the spectrum.  Therefore, yellow-green light will appears brighter to our eyes than either the red or the blue light of the same intensity.  To take the difference into account, a new set of physical measures of light is 
        	introduced for visible lights. these new metrics are called <term>photometric quantities</term>.
        </p>
        <p>
        	In the photometric quantities, power is weighted according to the human response by multiplying the radiometric quantity by a special function, called spectral luminance efficiency or the <m>V(\lambda)</m> function,  whose value is between 0 and 1. The <m>V</m> function takes care of the response of human eye to various wavelengths. The <m>V</m>-function was arrived at experimentally in 1924, and is an average response of a population of people in a wide range of ages.  The astronomical instruments use a <term> <m>V</m>-filter </term> for photometry.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The units as well as the names photometrics quantities differ from those in radiometry. For instance, power is simply called power in radiometry, but it is called the <term>luminous flux</term> in photometry, and while the unit of power in radiometry is <m>\text{Watt}</m>, in photometry it is <m>\text{lumen}</m>.  A <m>\text{lumen}</m> is defined in terms of a superfluous fundamental unit, called <term> candela</term>  which is one of the seven independent quantities of the SI system of units, viz. meter, kilogram, second, ampere, Kelvin, mole and candela.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Candela is the SI unit of the photometric quantity called <term>luminous intensity</term> or <term> luminosity</term>  that corresponds to the radiant intensity in radiometry.  The following working definition was adopted for candela in 16th General Conference on Weights and Measures  in 1979.
        </p>
        <p>
        	A monochromatic radiation source of frequency <m>540 \times 10^{12}\text{ Hz}</m> is said to have a luminous intensity of one candela in a given direction if it emits <m>\frac{1}{683}\text{ watt}</m> of power per steradian in that direction.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Since there are <m>\frac{4}{pi}</m>  steradians in the full solid angle around a source, the total power emitted by a one-candela source is <m>\frac{4}{683\pi}\text{ W}</m>, which is equal to <m>1.0\text{ lumen}</m>, if the source emits radiation isotropically in all directions.
        	<men>
        		1.0 \text{ lumen} = \frac{4}{683\pi}\text{ W}.
        	</men>
        	<xref ref="table-Radiometric-and-Photometric-Quantities-and-Units"/>  shows  the units of radiometry and photometry side by side.  Various sources of light are often labelled with  their luminance, which is the photometric term for the total power radiated per unit are per unit solid angle.  <xref ref="table-Luminance-of-Various-Sources"/> gives approximate luminance of  several sources of light.

		<statement>
			<p>
				What will be the luminance of moon if observed from half the distance to the moon? Luminance of Moonlight on Earth <m>= 3000\text{ nits}</m>.
			</p>
		</statement>
		<hint><p> Luminosity varies as inverse square of distance from an isotropic source. Assume moon as an isotropic source. </p></hint>

			<p>
				The luminosity will vary in space from the source (moon here) as the intensity varies. Let us assume moon to be an isotropic source of secondary light. Therefore, the luminosity at half the distance will be 4 times as much.
