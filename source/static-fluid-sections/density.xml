	<p>

		The quantity obtained by dividing mass <m> M </m> by volume <m> V </m> is called <term>density</term>, or more specifically, the average density. We denote density by the Greek letter rho, <m>\rho </m>.
			<men>
				\rho = \frac{M}{V}.
			</men>
		Density has the dimensions of mass over length cubed, and has SI unit of <m> \text{kg/m}^3 </m>.  A common unit of density is <m>\text{g/cc}</m>, or gram per cubic centimeter with the following conversion factor.
		<me>
			1\text{ g/cc} = 1000\text{ kg/m}^3.
		</me>
		Make sure you understand the source of the conversion factor.

		If it is hard to compress a material, ie., the volume change upon compression is negligible, then the density will also not vary with compression - we say that the substance is <term> incompressible</term>. Compared to gases, liquids are much less compressible, and we will make the assumption that liquids are incompressible. Of course, solids are even more incompressible.

		The density is a dimensionful property.  Therefore, you need to keep track of units when comparing densities of two materials.  For comparison purposes a more convenient dimensionless quantity, called <term> specific gravity </term>, is constructed by dividing the density of the material by the density of water at <m> 0^{\circ}\text{C}</m> and one atmospheric pressure, which is <m> 1\text{ g/cc}</m> or <m> 1000\text{ mg/m}^3</m>. 
		<me>
			\text{Specific gravity} = \dfrac{\text{Density of material}}{\text{Density of water}}
		</me>
		Specific gravity, being dimensionless, provides a ready comparison among materials without having to worry about the unit of density.  For instance density of aluminum is <m>2.7</m> in <m>\text{g/cc}</m> and <m>2700</m> in <m>\text{kg/m}^3</m>, but specific gravity is <m>2.7</m> regardless of the unit of density.
