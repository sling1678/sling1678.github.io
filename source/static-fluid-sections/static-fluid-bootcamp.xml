			<p>
				The weight of the block is balanced by the force due to pressure difference at the suction pump. Let <m>\Delta p</m> be the pressure difference. This pressure acts on the perpendicular area equal to the area of the circle at the mouth of the suction pump. Therefore, the force by the pressure differece will be

			<p>
				To find the shape of the surface, we will examine the dynamics of a small element of mass <m>dm=\rho dx dy dz</m> at coordinate <m>(x,y,z)</m> located at the surface of the spinning fluid as shown in <xref ref="fig-fluid-spinning-in-tube-shape-of-surface-sol"/>.

				<p>
					Let <m>P</m> denote the pressure immediately behind the fluid element. Two forces act on this element, viz., weight and the force by pressure, which will be directed prependicular to the surface. As a result of these forces, the element has a uniform circular motion of radius <m>r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</m>.

			</sidebyside>
			<p>
				From symmetry of the situation shown in <xref ref="fig-fluid-spinning-in-tube-shape-of-surface-sol"/>, it is sufficient to work with point <m>(x,y,z)=(0,y,z)</m>, and in the end replace <m>|y|</m> by <m>r</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				To find the components of the force by pressure of the fluid, we will need to find direction of this force. This force will be pointed perpendicular to the surface at that point, similar to what we expect from a normal force. To find this direction, we need to first find the tangential direction of the curve in the <m>yz</m>-plane. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Let <m>z(y)</m> be the curve in the <m>yz</m>-plane. The direction of the tangent, as given by the unit vector <m>\hat t</m>, will be
				<me>
					\hat t = b \left( \hat j + \left( \frac{dz}{dy} \right)\hat k \right),
				</me>
				where 
				<me>
					b = 1/\sqrt{1 + (dz/dy)^2}.
				</me>
				From this we get the direction of the force by pressure, to be denited by <m>\hat u</m>, will be
				<me>
					\hat u =  b\left(  - \left( \frac{dz}{dy}\right)\hat j + \hat k \right).
				</me>
				Therefore, force by pressure behind the element is
				<me>
					\vec F = PdA\;\hat u = b PdA \left[ - \left( \frac{dz}{dy}\right)\hat j + \hat k\right].
				</me>
				The other force is the weight
				<me>
					\vec W = -dm\; g \;\hat k.
				</me>
				Net force, <m>\vec F_\text{net} = \vec F + \vec W = m\vec a</m>, where <m>\vec a</m> is the centripetal acceleration, which for radius <m>y</m> and angular speed <m>\omega</m> will be 
				<me>
					\vec a = - \omega^2 y \hat j.
				</me>
				Therefore, we will get equations along <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> axis will be
				<md>
					<mrow>  - b\amp P dA \left( \frac{dz}{dy}\right) = -dm\;  \omega^2 y.</mrow>
					<mrow> b\amp PdA - dm\;  g = 0.</mrow>
				</md>
				Eliminating <m>PdA</m> from these two gives
				<me>
					 \frac{dz}{dy} = \frac{\omega^2}{g} y.
				</me>
				This differential equation has a simple solution.
				<me>
					z = \frac{\omega^2}{2g}\; y^2 + c,
				</me>
				where <m>c</m> is constant of integration. Since, <m>y=0,z=0</m> is on the curve, we have <m>c=0</m>. Thus,
				<me>
					z = \frac{\omega^2}{2g}\; y^2.
				</me>
				Replacing <m>|y|</m> by <m>r</m> we get
				<me>
					z = \frac{\omega^2}{2g}\; r^2.
