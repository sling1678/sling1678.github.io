				Consider rotating a rigid wheel about its axle by applying a force <m>\vec F</m> at the rim as shown in  <xref ref="fig-rotational-work-basic"/>.
				In time <m> \Delta t</m>, the force acts  parallel to the displacement <m> \Delta s</m> at the rim.  Therefore, the work done by the force will be
				<me>
					W = F \Delta s. 
				</me>

			This work can be written in terms of torque and angle <m> \Delta \theta</m> of rotation. With <m>R</m> as radius of the wheel, arc distance, <m> \Delta s  = R\Delta\theta</m>.
			<me>
				W = F\, \Delta s = F\, R\, \Delta\theta. 
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>	
			The torque by the force applied at the rim is <m> \tau = FR</m>.  Therefore, the work by the force in rotating the wheel by and angle <m> \Delta\theta</m> is
			<me>
				W = \tau \Delta \theta.

			This work is called <term>rotational work</term>.

				<p>
					A <m>12\text{-inch}</m>-long wrench is used to tighten a bolt by applying a steady force of <m> 5\text{ N}</m> at the end of the handle which is approximately <m>10\text{ inches}</m>   from the center of the bolt.

				(a) How much work is done for each quarter turn?

				(b) Suppose, you use a <m>6</m>-in wrench, and apply the same force, except that the force now would act at a distance of about <m> 5\text{ inches}</m> from the center of the bolt.   How much work would now be done for each quarter turn?

		<!-- <hint> <p>  (a) Use <m> W = \tau\Delta \theta</m> after expressing quantities in SI units. (b) Similarly as (a). </p> </hint> -->

		<solution> <title> a </title>
			<p>
				The lever arm of the <m> 5\text{ N}</m> force is
				<me>
					r_\perp = 10\text{ inches} \times 0.0254\text{ m/inch} = 0.254\text{ m}.
				</me>
				Therefore, the torque is
				<me>
					\tau = 5\text{ N} \times 0.254\text{ m} = 1.28\text{ N.m}.
				</me>
				The angle to be rotated at this torque level is
				<me>
					\Delta \theta = 0.25\text{ turn} \times 2\pi\text{ rad/turn} = \dfrac{\pi}{2}\text{ rad}.
				</me>
				Therefore, the rotational work is
				<me>
					W_\text{rot} = \tau\Delta \theta = 2.0\text{ N.m}.
				</me>
			</p>
		</solution>
		<solution> <title> b </title>
			<p>
				The lever arm of the <m> 5\text{ N}</m> force is now half as much. This factor will continue into the work.

				<me>
					W_\text{rot} = 1.0\text{ N.m}.
				</me>
