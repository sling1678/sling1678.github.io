    <title>First Law of Thermodynamics</title>

    <p>
    	Thermodynamics describes how macroscopic systems change when they interact with the environment. In the last chapter we discussed how heat exchange can occur between two systems at different temperatures. Heat is one way two systems exchange energy. Work between them is another way energy can flow between them. In this chapter we take a broader view and study other ways of exchanging energy between systems.
