<section><title> Elasticity and Stress</title>
	<subsection> <title> Elasticity </title>
		<p>
			Real materials react to external forces, as we have seen in the development of the Normal force. If the deformation is small compared to the physical dimensions of the object, many materials often recover the original shape when the external force is removed. This property is called <term>elasticity</term>.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can see the elastic behavior clearly when you hang weights by a wire as shown in  <xref ref="fig-elasticity-elongating-a-string" />.  The reaction force here is the tension in the wire caused by the weight. Initially, the stretch and tension are linearly related, <m>F = k \Delta L</m>, much like a spring. This part is the linear elastic region. If the tension increases beyond the linear limit, we get nonlinear behavior behavir, <m>F \ne k \Delta L</m>, but if you remove the tension, the wire still returns to the original length. 
		</p>

				Elasticity of a wire. The wire stretches as weights are added. Initially, tension in the wire and the stretch are linearly related, e.g., as for a spring force, <m> F \propto \Delta L</m>. After some amount of stretch, the relation is not linear anymore, but the sire is still able to return to the original length, when we remove the weight. But if we continue to add more weights, we enter the region shown dashed, where the wire does not go back to the original length. The dashed region is the plastic region. If we continue to add more weights, eventiually, we reach a maximum tension, shown as <m>F_\text{max}</m>, at which point, the wire breaks.

		</figure>	
		<p>
			Beyond the elastic limit, there is a region, where wire still stretches, but when you remove the tension-causing weights, the wire is pemanently elongated. This is called plastic region.  
		</p>

		<p>
			If you continue to add more weight to the wire, eventually the wire will break at some point, called the <m> breaking point</m>.  The breaking point gives us information about the ultimate strength of the material.   
		</p>
		<p>
			We will be concerned with the elastic range here since we want a predictable linear restoring force to help analyze the equilibrium behavior of structures so as to prevent permanent deformation or fracture.
		</p>
 
		<p>
			In the linear elastic regime, the force <m>F</m> applied to the wire is proportional to the elongation <m>\Delta L</m>.
				<men xml:id="eq-hooke-law-int-1">
					F= k \Delta L, 
				</men>
			where <m> k </m> is a proportionality constant. This observation was first made by Robert Hooke (1635-1703), a contemporary of Isaac Newton, and is often called Hooke's law, which states that <q> Ut tensio sic uis,</q> in Latin, meaning <q> As the extension, so the force</q>.    
		</p>
		<p>
			The reason for a material <q> to act like</q> springs can be traced to the inter-atomic bonds in materials as illustrated in <xref ref="fig-springy-materials" />, which have a spring-like behavior for small displacement from equilibrium.
		</p>
		<figure xml:id="fig-springy-materials">
			<caption>
				The elastic properties of materials emerge from spring-like bonding of molecules inside the material as illustrated here. When a wire stretches vertically, the <q>bonds</q> stretch in that direction, creating a restoring force that pulls on both ends. These molecular forces are responsible for stress in the material.

	<subsection> <title> Strain </title>

		<p>
			To measure the amount of deformation from the initial length as a fraction, it is customary to introduce a quantity, called the strain or relative deformation, by the following relation:
			<men xml:id="eq-strain-definition">
				\text{Strain} = \dfrac{\text{Deformation}}{\text{Original Length}} =\dfrac{\Delta L}{L_0}  
			</men>
			Clearly, strain is a dimensionless quantity since it is a ratio of two lengths. 
		</p> 
		<p>
			There are other types of strain when we have deformation of the area or volume, defined in similar way. We will encounter them later in the book.
		</p>
	</subsection>

	<subsection> <title> Stress </title>
		<p>
			Experiments show that, for the same force, a wire stretches less if it is thicker.  Therefore, the effectiveness of a force to cause strain in a material is contained in force per unit cross-sectional area  of the wire rather than the force alone.  
			To describe the cause of the strain, we define a quantity, called <term> stress</term>, which is equal to force per unit area.  The magnitude of stress is given by
			<men xml:id="eq-stress-definition">
				\text{Stress} = \dfrac{\text{Magnitude of Force}}{\text{Area of cross-section}} = \dfrac{F}{A}.
			</men>
			Note that stress will have direction since force has direction.  Even the area of cross-section has an orientation.  For instance, the six sides of a cube have different orientations in space.  Therefore, in general, the direction of stress is dependent on the direction of the force and the orientation of the area upon which the force acts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The dimension of stress can be found from the ratio of the dimensions of force and area.  
			<men> 
				[\text{stress}] = \dfrac{[F]}{[A]} = \dfrac{[M][L]/[T]^2}{[L]^2} = \dfrac{[M]}{[L][T]^2}.
			</men>
			This gives the unit of stress to be <m>\text{N/m}^2</m>, which is also called Pascal denoted by <m>\text{P}</m>.

	<subsection> <title> General Hooke's Law </title>
		<p>

			Hooke's law given in Eq. <xref ref="eq-hooke-law-int-1" />can be written using the stress and strain by dividing both sides of the equation by the area <m> A </m> and introducing the factor <m> L_0/L_0</m> on the right side.
			<men>
				\dfrac{F}{A} = \dfrac{k}{A}\Delta L =\left( \dfrac{kL_0}{A} \right)\dfrac{\Delta L}{L_0}.
			</men>
			Writing the constants given in parenthesis as one letter <m>Y</m>, we have the Hooke's law for a change in length of the wire as
			<men ref="eq-hooke-law-general">
				\text{Stress} = Y \times \text{Strain}
			</men>
			The proportionality constant <m>Y</m> is called the Young's modulus.  The unit of Young's modulus is the same as that of stress, i.e., <m>\text{N/m}^2</m> or Pascal, since strain in unitless. This relation between stress in a body and the strain of the body is a general statement of Hooke's law.
