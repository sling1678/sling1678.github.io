		<p>
			If strain in a matrial is not too great, the material will go back to the original shape when stress-causing force is removed. <emph> The energy stored in the strained material in the elastic region is just like the energy of a spring and is called <term> elastic energy</term>. </emph>
			<!-- Recall that the energy stored in a spring is given by the following formula
			<me>
				U = \dfrac{1}{2}k (\Delta l)^2,
			</me>
			where <m> \Delta l</m> is the change in the length of the spring and <m> k </m> is the spring constant.  -->
		</p>
		<p>
			When you strecth a wire by pulling on it by some force at the ends as in <xref  ref="fig-strain-energy-wire-stretched" />, the quantity <m> Y A/L</m> acts similar to spring constant of a spring. 
			<me>
				k \equiv Y\dfrac{A}{L},
			</me>
			with the stretching <m>\Delta L</m> to be the <m>x</m> of spring.
			<me>
				x \equiv \Delta L,
			</me>
			and strain will be
			<me>
				\epsilon = \dfrac{\Delta L}{L} = \dfrac{x}{L}.
			</me> 
		</p>
		<p>
			Therefore, potential energy stored in a strained material, i.e., the elastic energy, will be
			<me>
				U = \dfrac{1}{2} k x^2 =  \dfrac{1}{2}  \dfrac{YA}{L} \left( \Delta L \right)^2 = \dfrac{1}{2}YV\epsioon^2,
			</me>
			where <m> V = AL</m>, the volume of the material. This elastic energy is due to the stretching of the wire, therefore, it is also called <term>tensile energy</term>. A similar formula can be obtained for compressive elastic energy. Dividing by the volume of the wire, we see that <term>elastic energy density</term>, i.e., elastic energy per unit volume depends only on the elastic modulus and strain.
			<me>
				u = \dfrac{U}{V} = \dfrac{1}{2}  Y \, \epsilon^2.
			</me>

		<p>
			When you look at a volume deformation, the strain is
			<me>
				\epsilon = \dfrac{\Delta V}{V},
			</me>
			and the modulus is the bulk modulus, <m>B</m>. The elastic energy stored in volume strain is
			<men>
				U = \frac{1}{2}B V \epsilon^2.
			</men>
		</p>

		<sidebyside widths="60% 10% 30%">
			<p>
				Similarly, the energy stored in shear strain <m>\theta</m> is
				<men>
					U = \frac{1}{2}V G \theta^2,
				</men>
				where <m> G</m> is the shear modulus.

			From different formulas for different types of deformation, you can guess a common formula that you can apply to any type.

				U = \dfrac{1}{2} V \times \text{Modulus} \times \text{Strain}^2.

				First we find the strain <m>\Delta L/L</m> by Hooke's law. For that we need to work out stress, for which we need the area of cross-section.
				<md>
					<mrow> A = \pi R^2 = \pi \times \left( 2\times 10^{-3} \right)^2 = 1.25\times 10^{-5}\text{ m}^2 </mrow>
					<mrow> F = mg = 100\times 9.81 = 981\text{ N}</mrow>
				</md>
				Therefore, stress in the cable is
				<me>
					\text{Stress } = \dfrac{F}{A} = 7.8\times 10^7\text{ N/m}^2.
				</me>
				Using <m> Y = 220\text{ GPa} = 220\times 10^9\text{ Pa}</m>, we can get the strain caused in the cable.
				<me>
					\dfrac{\Delta L}{L} = \dfrac{1}{Y} \dfrac{F}{A} = 3.55\times 10^{-4}.
				</me>
				Therefore, the tensile energy stored in the cable is

				The Achiles tendon contracts and stretches as you run.  Suppose a <m>80\text{-kg}</m> man has <m>10\text{-cm}</m> long tendon with area of cross-section <m>0.75\text{ cm}^2</m>.  Data: Young's modulus of tendon = <m>1.5\text{ GPa}</m>.

			<p>
				(a)
				(i) 
				From the statement we note that a force of 5 times the weight acts on an area <m>0.75\text{ cm}^2</m>, which will give stress

				(ii) With this stress, the strain will be
				<me>
					\dfrac{\Delta L}{L} = \dfrac{\text{ Stress}}{Y} = \dfrac{5.23\times 10^7}{1.5\times 10^9} = 0.035.
