	<problem><title> Torque on Ammonia Molecule and Energy for Flipping the Orientation of Dipole Moment </title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				An ammonia molecule has an electric dipole moment of <m>5.0 \times 10^{-30}</m> C.m.  It is placed in an external electric field of <m>1,000</m> V/m.  (a) What is the torque on it at the time the dipole is pointed at a <m>60^{\circ}</m> angle with respect to the electric field?  (b) Once aligned, how much energy will it take to flip the orientation of the dipole by <m>180^{\circ}</m>? Write your answer in the electron volt (eV) unit.  The unit <m>1</m> eV = <m>1.6\times 10^{-19}</m> J.
			</p>

		</statement>
		<hint> <p>  Use definitions </p> </hint>
		<answer> <p>  (a)  <m>4.3\times 10^{-27}</m> N.m, (b)  <m>6.3\times 10^{-8}</m>  eV.  </p> </answer>
		<solution> 
			<p>

 (a)	The torque on a dipole is equal to the vector product of the dipole moment and the electric field.  Therefore, the magnitude of the torque will be
<me>
\tau = p\:E\:\sin\theta = 5.0\times 10^{-30}\:\textrm{C.m}\times 1000\:\dfrac{\textrm{V}}{\textrm{m}}\:\sin 60^{\circ} = 4.33\times 10^{-27}\:\textrm{N.m}.
</me>
The direction of the torque vector can be obtained by using the right-hand rule.  therefore, if you place the vector <m>\vec p</m> towards the positive <m>x</m>-axis and vector <m>\vec E</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane towards a direction in the space <m>y>0</m>, then the torque will be pointed towards the positive <m>z</m>-axis.
</p>
<p> 
 (b)	 Flipping of a dipole's direction requires energy equal to <m>2pE</m>.
<me>
U = 2pE = 2\times 5.0\times 10^{-30}\:\textrm{C.m}\times 1000\:\dfrac{\textrm{V}}{\textrm{m}} = 1.0\times 10^{-26}\:\textrm{J}.
</me>
