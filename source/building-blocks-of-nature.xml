    <title>Building Blocks of Nature INPROGRESS</title>

    <p>
        What are the ultimate building blocks of all matter and how do they interact to form the universe? Philosophers and scientists have asked these questions for a long time. In 1800s the hundred or so chemical elements listed in the periodic table appear to explain all matter around us. But, in 1899, J. J. Thomson showed that atoms were not fundamental - he was able to detect particles that were 2000 times lighter than the lightest atom known at the time. And so began the race to find even more fundamental particles than atoms.

        Rapid progress in theory and experimental techniques in the 1900s have improved our understanding of the fundamental physics considerably. The theoretical understanding has been guided by the introduction of quantum mechanics and special theory of relativity. The improvements in particle detection technology and accelerator physics have made it possible to test predictions of theories. Our present understanding of the fundamental constituents of all matter and the interactions among them is summarized in a model called the \textbf{standard model}\index{Standard model} of particle physics, or simply the standard model, which we will study in this chapter.
