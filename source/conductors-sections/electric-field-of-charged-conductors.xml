	<!-- <introduction>
		<p>
			Electric field inside a conductor is zero everywhere. 
		</p>
		<p>
			From the perspective of a point immediately outside a charged metal surface, nearby metal surface appear to be a flat charged sheet. We know that electric field of a flat charged sheet is directed perpendicular to the surface. This tells us that electric field lines are perpendicular to the surface of the conductor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Furthermore, since magnitude of electric field of a charged sheet of surface charge density <m>\sigma</m> is <m>\sigma/\epsilon_0</m>. This tells us that just outside the external surface of a conductor, electric field will depend on the local charge density.
			<me>
				E_\text{near surface} = \dfrac{\sigma_\text{local}}{\epsilon}.
			</me> 
		</p>
		<p>
			These conclusions can be used to get ideas about electric field lines in the presence of conductors. For instance, an isolated point charge has electric field lines that radially go out in all directions from the charge. But, when we bring a metal piece near the charge, electric field lines must bend so that they meet the conductor at <m>90^\circ</m> to the surface.

				 Electric field for a charge in the presence of a conductor. (a)  Near a charge, E-field lines emanate in all directions and near a conductor, they are <m>90^\circ</m> to the surface of the conductor, which is polarized due to the presence of the external charge.  (b)  Electric field lines bend so that they are normal to the conductor. Inside the body of the conductor, E=0, whick means not E-field lines passes through the conductor.

	<subsection><title>An Isolated Charged Metallic Sphere </title>
		<p>
			Consider an isolated metallic sphere of radius <m>R</m> that has a total excess charge <m>+q</m> placed on it.  The entire charge <m>+q</m> on the metallic sphere will end up at the surface as shown in <xref ref="fig-charged-spherical-metal-setup"/>.  Furthermore, as there are no other charges or bodies around, the charge distribution on the spherical surface will be spherically symmetric.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Aside Note: If there were other objects in the neighborhood of the metallic sphere, then the charges on the surface of the sphere will not necessarily be spherically symmetric - there will be more charges in certain direction than in other directions.  
		</p>

		<sidebyside widths="60% 10% 30%">
			<p>
				Since spherically distributed charge densiy has a spherical symmetry, we apply Gauss's law to easily get the magnitude of electric field. 
				<me>
					E(r) = \begin{cases}
								0 \amp r \lt R\\
								\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\dfrac{q}{r^2} \amp r \gt R
							\end{cases}
				</me>
				The direction of the electric field will be radially outward from the center of the sphere.

		</sidebyside>

 		
		<p>
			The electric field outside the charged spherical conductor is indistinguishable from that of a point charge <m>+q</m> placed at the center without the conductor present. The difference between the charged metal and a point charge occurs only at the space points inside the conductor:  for a point charge placed at the center of the sphere, the electric field will not be zero at points of space occupied by the sphere, but for a conductor with the same amount of charge has a zero electric field at those points.  However, there is no distinction at the outside points in space where <m>r > R</m>, and we can replace the isolated charged spherical conductor by a point charge at its center with impunity.
		</p>
		<p> <alert> Electric Potential of a Charged Metallic Sphere</alert></p>
		<p>
			We find electric potential at a point P by integrating  negative of the dot product of electric field with displacement from <m>r=\infty</m> (reference point) to the <m>r=r</m>. 
		</p>
		<sidebyside widths="50% 5% 45%">
			<p>
				With P outside, we get the same expression for potential as that of a point charge, but in the space inside the sphere, we get constant potential. These are sketched in <xref ref="fig-spherical-metal-potential-sketch"/>
