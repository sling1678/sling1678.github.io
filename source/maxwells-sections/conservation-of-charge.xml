	<introduction> 
		<p>
			The principle of conservation of charge is automatically included in Maxwell's equations.  To see it explicitly we can use the point form of Maxwell's equations. First,  let us  take the divergence of both sides of the Ampere-Maxwell's law and then use the Gauss's law for the electric field. 
			<md>
				<mrow> \vec{\nabla}\cdot(\vec{\nabla}\times \vec B) \amp  = \vec{\nabla} \cdot \left(\mu_0 \vec J + \mu_0\epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \vec E}{\partial t} \right)</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp  = \mu_0 \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec J + \mu_0\epsilon_0  \frac{\partial }{\partial t}(\vec{\nabla}\cdot \vec E)</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp  = \mu_0 \left( \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec J +  \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} \right) </mrow>
			</md>
			Since, the divergence of a curl is zero, the left side is identically zero.  Therefore, we find that
			<men xml:id="eq-eqn-continuity-1">
				\vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec J +  \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}  = 0. 
			</men>
			This equation is called the <term> equation of continuity</term>,  which is a statement of conservation of charge at each space point. We can see this fact by integrating =over a volume, <m>V</m>, which is enclosed by a close surface <m>S</m>.
			<me>
				\int_V \vec{\nabla} \cdot \vec J\, dxdydz = -   \frac{\partial }{\partial t}  \int_V \rho\, dxdydz.
			</me>
			The left side is the flux of charges out of the surface and the right side is the rate at which net charge within the volume, <m>Q_v</m>, decreases with time.
			<me>
				\oint_S \vec J\cdot d\vec A = - \dfrac{d}{dt}Q_V.
			</me>
			That is, amount of charges leaving the volume due to current through the enclosing surface in some time <m>\Delta t</m>  must equal the net decrease in charge within the volume in that time. Thus, net electric charge can neither be created or destroyed.


			<!-- From our discussion on the divergence above, you know that the first term of this equation  is equal to the charge per unit volume leaving a surface per unit time enclosing a point and the second term is the rate at which the density of charge in the volume changes with time. If no charge can be created or destroyed at any point, then the two terms must add up to zero as demanded by this equation. -->

			Let us look at Eq. <xref ref="eq-eqn-continuity-1"/> more closely and see how the divergence of the current density gives us the rate at which charges leave a point.  Consider a rectangular box in which the current enters at the left face (coordinate <m>x</m>) with the current density <m>\vec J(x)</m>, which may vary along the box as shown in <xref ref="fig-eqn-continuity"/>.  The current leaves the right face (coordinate <m>x+  \Delta x</m>) with the current density there given by <m>\vec J(x+\Delta x)</m>.   We now ask the question: how much charge accumulates in the box in a duration  <m>\Delta t</m>?  We can answer this question by the following step-by-step arguments. To simplify the discussion, we assume that the current density has only the <m>x</m>-component non-zero.

		<p>
			The amount of charge flowing in the box, at <m>x</m>, in time  <m>\Delta t</m>, = <m>|J_x (x) A  \Delta t|</m>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The amount of charge flowing out of the box, at <m> x+\Delta x</m>, in time <m>\Delta t</m>, = <m>|J_x (x+ \Delta x) A  \Delta t|</m>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Net charge accumulation due to flow in and out of the box = <m> \left|J_x(x) - J_x(x+ \Delta x)\right|A \Delta  t</m>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Increase of charge density in the box in time  <m>\Delta t</m> would be
			<me>
			 	\frac{ \left|J_x(x) - J_x(x+ \Delta x)\right|A \Delta  t}{A\Delta x}.
			</me>
 		</p>
		<p>
			Hence, the rate of increase of charge density in the box is equal to  <m>\left|J_x(x)  - J_x(x+ \Delta x)\right|/\Delta x</m>.
			By the principle of the conservation of charge, this must be equal  to the rate of increase of charge density in the box as accounted by the charge density itself. 
			<me>
				\frac{\Delta \rho}{\Delta t} = \frac{ \left|J_x(x)A  t - J_x(x+ \Delta x)\right|}{\Delta x} 
			</me>
			When we shrink the box by taking the limit <m>x \rightarrow 0</m>, we obtain the following rate of change of charge density at the point P in the box.
			<me>
				\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = -\frac{dJ_x}{dx}
			</me>
			When you consider currents flowing in all directions you will get the full continuity equation.
			<me>
				\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = -\left( \frac{\partial J_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial J_y}{\partial y}  + \frac{\partial J_z}{\partial z}  \right) 
			</me>
