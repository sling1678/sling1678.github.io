				<p>
					(a) Let us place <m>x</m> axis along the wire with origin at one end as shown in <xref ref="fig-pr-E-field-at-a-Point-on-the-Axis-of-the-Wire-sol-a"/>. Each charge element on the wire will have only <m>x</m> component of the electric field. For instance, electric field of the element <m>dq = \lambda\; dx</m> will be
					<me>
						dE_x = k \frac{\lambda\; dx}{ \left( L+a-x \right)^2}.

				<p>
					Integrating this from <m>x=0</m> to <m>x=L</m> will give the net field at <m>\text{P}_1</m>.
					<md>
						<mrow>E_x \amp= k\lambda\;  \int_0^L \frac{dx}{ \left( L+a-x \right)^2} </mrow>
						<mrow>  \amp=- k\lambda\;  \int_{L+a}^a \frac{dy}{ y^2} \ \ \ (y=L+a-x) </mrow>

					Note that this is not <m>kq/r^2</m>. If we write <m>q=\lambda L</m> for net charge on the wire and place the entire charge at the center, the field at <m>\text{P}_1</m> will be

					This is definitely very different from the answer we found for the problem. Only in the limit <m>a \gg L </m>, the two expressions become in indistinguishable.
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution><title>(b)</title>
				<p>
					(b)
					Here we see that electric field of charge on points to the left of <m>\text{P}_2</m> is pointed to right but points on the right are pointed to left. Using (a), we can write the electric field of left and right separately. But, when we do this calculation naively, by setting <m>a=0</m> in the answer for (a), you will run into trouble of dividing by zero. To avoid that, we find field at an infintesimal left of <m>\text{P}_2</m> and infinitesimal right of <m>\text{P}_2</m>.
				</p>
				<p>

					<me>
						E_{\text{left},x} = k\lambda\; \left( \frac{1}{\epsilon}  - \frac{1}{L}\right)

					<me>
						E_{\text{right},x} = -k\lambda\; \left( \frac{1}{\epsilon}  - \frac{1}{L-b}\right)
					</me>
					Adding them, we find that the arbitrarily chosen infinitesimal size <m>\epsilon</m> cancels out giving us the following, which correctly gives zero for the midpoint.
