	<introduction>
		<p>
			Here, we want to address the question: How do you get net electric field if multiple fields are acting at the same time?
		</p>
		<p>
			Recall that net force on an object is a vector sum of the forces on that object. Now, if several charges act on a test charge <m>Q</m>, with forces <m>\vec F_1</m>, <m>\vec F_2</m>, <m>\cdots</m>,  <m>\vec F_N</m>, then, net electric force on <m>Q</m> will be
			<me>
				\vec F_e = \vec F_1 + \vec F_2 + \cdots + \vec F_N. 
			</me>
			Now, if we divide both sides by the test charge, we will get
			<me>
				\frac{\vec F_e}{Q} = \frac{\vec F_1}{Q} + \frac{\vec F_2}{Q} + \cdots + \frac{\vec F_N}{Q}. 
			</me>			
			Each of the <m>\vec F_i/Q</m> is actually, the electric field from the corresponding source, which we can denote by <m>\vec E_i</m>. One the left is the net electric force divided by the test charge, so, we get the net electric field there, which we denote by <m>\vec E_P</m>. Therefore, we find that, just like forces, electric fields also add vectorially to give the net electric field. 
			<men xml:id="eq-e-field-super-1">
				\vec E_P = \vec E_1 + \vec E_2 + \cdots + \vec E_N. 
			</men>
			This result is called <term>superposition of electric fields</term>. We will work out examples of this principle below.

					Four charged plates are arranged with positive plates facing the negative plates.

		<answer> <p>  <m>9\text{ N/C}</m> in the positive <m>x</m> direction. </p> </answer>
		<solution> 
			<p>
				The following figure shows the electric field of the two charges at the origin are along the <m>x</m> axis, but they are in the opposite direction. We will compute <m>x</m> components of the two fields so that we can deal with their addition through the sign of the components.
			</p>
			<image source="./images/coulombs-law/E-field-two-charges-on-x-axis-solution.png" width="70%"/>
			<p>
				The <m>x</m> component of the fields are

					<mrow> E_{1x} \amp = + k\dfrac{|q_1|}{r_1^2} = 9\times 10^{9} \times \dfrac{5\times 10^9}{2^2} = 11.25\text{ N/C}, </mrow>

				Therefore, <m>x</m> component of the net electric field at origin is
				<me>
					E_x = E_{1x} + E_{2x} = 11.25 + (- 2.25) = 9\text{ N/C}.

		<solution> 
			<p>
				The following figure shows the electric field of the two charges are pointed in <m>xy</m>-plane. We will compute <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> components of the two fields so that we can deal with their addition through their components.

				The <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> components of electric field <m>\vec E_1</m>  are
				<md>
					<mrow> E_{1x} \amp = k\dfrac{q_1}{r_1^2} \dfrac{x_P-x_1}{r_1}, </mrow>
					<mrow> E_{1y} \amp = k\dfrac{q_2}{r_2^2} \dfrac{y_P-y_1}{r_1}, </mrow>
				</md>
				and similarly for charge <m>q_2</m>. Computing the numerical values is easier by working out the parts of the formula first.
				<md>
					<mrow> r_1 \amp = \sqrt{ \left(x_P-x_1 \right)^2 + \left(y_P-y_1 \right)^2 } </mrow>
					<mrow>  \amp = \sqrt{ \left(0-(-2) \right)^2 + \left(1-0 \right)^2 } = \sqrt{ 5}\text{ m}. </mrow>
					<mrow> r_2 \amp = \sqrt{ \left(x_P-x_2 \right)^2 + \left(y_P-y_2 \right)^2 } </mrow>
					<mrow>  \amp = \sqrt{ \left(0-(4) \right)^2 + \left(1-0 \right)^2 } = \sqrt{ 17}\text{ m}. </mrow>
				</md>
				Therefore, the components of <m>\vec E_1</m> will be

					<mrow> E_{1x} \amp = 9\times 10^9\times\dfrac{5\times 10^{-9}}{ (\sqrt{5})^2 } \times \dfrac{0-(-2)}{\sqrt{5}} = 8.05\text{ N/C}, </mrow>

				</md>
				and those of <m>\vec E_2</m> will be
				<md>
					<mrow> E_{2x} \amp = 9\times 10^9\times\dfrac{4\times 10^{-9}}{ (\sqrt{17})^2 } \times \dfrac{0-(4)}{\sqrt{17}} = -2.05\text{ N/C}, </mrow>
					<mrow> E_{2y} \amp = 9\times 10^9\times\dfrac{4\times 10^{-9}}{ (\sqrt{17})^2 } \times \dfrac{1-0}{\sqrt{17}} = 0.51\text{ N/C}, </mrow>

				Therefore, the net electric field at P has the following components.

				The magnitude of electric field will be

					E_P = \sqrt{ 6.00^2 + 4.53^2 } = 7.52\text{ N/C},

				and the direction will be given by the counterclockwise angle <m>\theta</m> from the positive <m>x</m> axis,
