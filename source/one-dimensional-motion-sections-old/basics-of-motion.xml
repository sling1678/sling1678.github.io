<section xml:id="Basics-of-Motion"><title> Basics of Motion </title>

	<introduction>

		<p>
			Motion is the study of moving objects. However, to describe motion, you need to be able to tell distance and direction from another object or place and be able to tell time. 
		</p>
		<p><alert>Time.</alert></p>
		<p>
			For time measurements, we use clocks, which are devices that are based on measuring duration of repeating phenomenon. For instance, you could use a clock that counts days, which is based on rotation of Earth, or a clock that counts periods of a pendulum, or a clock that counts period of oscillations of a quaertz crystal, etc. Currently, best clocks are based on atomic physics. 
		</p>
		<p>
			National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA, has developed cesium-based atomic clocks that measure <m>9,192,631,770\text{ oscilaltions per second}</m> of the light emitted by an atom - so, one second is the time it takes for <m>9,192,631,770\text{ oscilaltions}</m>. These clocks keep extremely accurate time; as of 2020, they keep time within 1/3,000,000 of a second per year. You can visit  <url href="https://www.nist.gov/pml/time-and-frequency-division/background-how-nist-f2-works"> the NIST website for F2 clock </url> to learn more. The unit of time most commonly used in physics is seconds, abbreviated by <m>\text{s}</m> or <m>\text{sec}</m>.
		</p>
		<p><alert>Distance.</alert></p>
		<p>
			Distance measurements can be made with your foot, your arm, measureing tape, ruler, mile markers on the road, standard <q>known</q> distances of stars, etc. For a long time, a standard meter stick was used to standardize one meter, but that turned out to be not as good as just setting an exact value of speed of light in vaccum, denoted by letter <m>c</m>,
			<me>
				c = 3\times 10^{8}\text{ m/s}.\ \ \ \ \text{(Exactly!)}
			</me>
			This tells us that one meter is distance traveled by light in <m>\dfrac{1}{ 3.00\times 10^{8}}\text{ s}</m>.
			<me>
				1\text{ m} = \text{ distance light travels in } \dfrac{1}{ 3\times 10^{8}}\text{ s}.
			</me>

		</p>
		<p><alert>Direction.</alert></p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, telling direction is not as easy as it sounds. If motion is on a straight line, you can place the motion on the <m>x</m> axis and indicate direction by using the directions of the positive <m>x</m> axis and negative <m>x</m> axis. Thus, if you drive car in the direction of the positive <m>x</m> axis, your direction of motion will be same as the direction of the postive <m>x</m> axis. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If motion is in a plane, e.g., on a flat Earth surface, we might use <m>xy</m> plane for the motion; then we can tell direction by angle with respect to the <m>x</m> axis. This is the system we use when we tell someone to go <m>30^\circ</m> North of East direction - what we mean is that take East to be <m>x</m> axis and North to be <m>y</m> axis, then direction is <m>\theta = 30^{\circ}</m> towards <m>y</m> axis from the direction of <m>x</m> axis. 
		</p>

		<p>
			If motion is in three-dimensional space, then, we might use angles <m>\theta</m> and <m>\phi</m> of a spherical coordinate system. We will discuss them in a later chapter.
		</p>

	<subsection><title> All Motion is Relative</title>
		<p>
			Suppose you are driving a car at speed <m>30\text{ mph}</m>. By this statement, we mean that car is moving <em>with respect to ground</em> at <m>30\text{ mph}</m>. If I asked you a different question: what is the speed of the car with respect to you? Clearly, you are moving with the car and hence car is not moving with respect to you. Therefore, you will say that speed of the car is zero.
		</p>
		<p>
			This example illustrates that <alert> motion is fundamentally relative</alert>. That is, whether an object is moving or not and by how much depends on choice of reference. The reference can be a physical object or just some point in space. 
		</p>
		<sidebyside widths="50% 5% 45%">
			<p>
				We take reference itself to be fixed in time, and describe motion of the object under study by noting whether distance and direction in relation to the reference is changing in time.	We usually, place origin of a Cartesian coordinate system at the reference object and use Cartesian axes for distance and direction.
