<section xml:id="oneD-Constant-Acceleration-Motion"> <title> Constant Acceleration Motion </title>

	<p>
		The one-dimensional kinematics for constant acceleration motion plays an important practical role. Typically, we are interested in a motion between two instants in time, which we call the initial and final instants. We use subscripts <m> i </m> and <m> f </m> to denote quantities at these instants. The following diagram illustrates the setup.
	</p>
	<figure>
		<caption>
			Set up for constant acceleration motion along the <m> x </m> axis with <m> a_x </m> same throughout the interval. The time interval of interest is <m> \Delta t = t_f - t_i</m>. The initial and final positions are <m> x_i </m> and <m> x_f </m> respectively, with displacement <m> \Delta x = x_f - x_i</m>. The initial and final velocities are <m> v_{i,x} </m> and <m> v_{f,x} </m> resectively, with change <m> \Delta v_x = v_{f,x} - v_{i,x} </m>.

	<p> 
		We denote the interval by <m> \Delta t = t_f - t_i </m>, the change in position by <m> \Delta x = x_f-x_i </m>, and change in velocity by <m> \Delta v_x = v_{f,x} - v_{i,x} </m>. 
	</p>

			</mdn>
		where
			<men>
				v_{av,x} = \dfrac{v_{i,x} + v_{f,x}}{2}.

		It is possible to eliminate <m> \Delta t </m> from these equations to obtain

		</men>
		which we will refer to as the <q>no-<m>t</m>-equation </q>.
		It is also possible to eliminate <m> v_{f,x} </m> to obtain another useful equation

			Some special motions require simplified analysis. For instance, <alert> if velocity is constant</alert>, then, in these equations
			<me>
				a_x = 0\ \ \ \ (\text{constant velocity case})
			</me> 
		</p>
		<p>
			Another important special situation occurs when speed is constant during a motion. Speed at an instant is equal to the absolute value of the velocity at that instant, i.e., in one-dimensional situation, you would strip the sign of the velocity to get the speed at that instant.  Even though you can get speed at an instant from the velocity at that instant, the <alert> average speed </alert> during an interval is not related to the average velocity over that interval due to the way averaging is done in the two cases. 
		</p>
		<p>

			Average speed to be denoted by the symbol <m> v_{s,av}</m> is totality of distance covered divided by the time taken. Thus, if you move from origin to <m> x = 10 \text{ cm}</m> and return to origin, you would actually cover a distance of <m> 20 \text{ cm}</m>  even though your <m> \Delta x = 0 </m> since your initial <m> x </m> is the same as your final <m> x</m>.
			We denote the actual distance covered by the letter <m> d </m>. In <alert> constant speed </alert> motion following equations are used.

	<p><alert>Sign conventions.</alert>
		We use a sign convention to follow the directions of velocity and acceleration. The source of these sign conventions will become clear after you learn vectors. The following diagrams clarify the sign assignments of velocity and acceleration.

		<statement>
			<p>
				A skier is coming down a steep slope with a constant acceleration <m> a = 3.0\text{ m/s}^2</m>.  If the speed of the skier at the top of the hill was <m> 0 </m>, what is his speed when he has skied a distance of <m> 40 \text{ m}</m> down the hill? Take the positive <m> x </m> axis to point down the hill.

		<solution> 
			<p> For the sake of brevity, we will drop the  coordinate  subscript <m> x </m> from the symbols.
				Here taking the <m> x </m> axis down the hill makes all the motion along the <m> x </m> axis. From the problem statement, we can get the following.
				<me>
					a = 3.0\text{ m/s}^2,\ \ \Delta x = 40 \text{ m},\ \ v_i = 0,\ \ v_f = ?
				</me>
				The <q>no-<m>t</m>-equation</q> is perfect for this and gives
				<me>
					v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a (\Delta x)^2 = 0 + 2 \times 3 \times 40^2 = 9600.
				</me>
				Taking square root of both sides gives two values
				<me>
					v_f = \pm 98\text{ m/s}.
				</me>
				Since the velocity we want to in the direction of the positive <m> x </m> axis, we want the positive root.
				<me>
					v_f = + 98\text{ m/s}.

				We want the speed, which is the absolute value of this velocity.

(a) Assuming constant acceleration, how far has the truck moved in this time? (b) What is the acceleration of the truck?
		    </p>

		<hint> 
			<p>
				Assume <m> x </m> axis down the incline.

			<p>
				(a) <m> 300.0 </m> m, (b) <m> 0.67 \text{ m/s}^2</m> pointed down the incline.
			</p>
		</answer>
		<solution>
			<p>
				(a) Since we have a constant acceleration situation, it is easy to get average velocity from the initial and final velocities. Here, the initial velocity <m> v_i = 0 </m> since the truck was not moving initially, and the final velocity <m> v_f = 20.0 </m> m/s.
				<me> v_{av} = \dfrac{0 + 20.0}{2} = 10.0 \text{ m/s}.</me>
				Therefore, the distance moved in <m> t = 30.0 </m> sec:
				<me> \Delta x = v_{av} t = 10.0 \text{ m/s} \times 30.0 \text{ s} = 300.0 \text{ m}.</me> 
			</p>
			<p> 
				(b) To get <m> a </m>, we just use the velocities and time given.

				From the description, it is clear that truck's speed is picking up. Hence, the direction of the acceleration is same as the direction in which the truck is moving, which is down the inclined road.

    <exercise xml:id="ex-Modeling-a-Varying-Acceleration-by-Average-Constant-Acceleration"><title> Modeling a Varying Acceleration by Average Constant Acceleration </title>
		<statement>
			<p> 
				A cheeta's acceleration varies during its motion over a wide range. An example is given in <xref ref="pr-Acceleration-and-Displacement-for-a-Cheetah-from-Speed-Versus-Time-Plot"/> below. Even though, the real-life situation is complicated, we can get a lot of physics by modeling the motion <alert> as if</alert> the motion was a constant acceleration motion, by replacing the varying acceleration by an average acceleration value. You would, of course not get the exact values, but your answer will be in the right ball park.
			</p>
			<p>
				Suppose, the average acceleration of a cheetah between <m> t=0 </m> and <m> t = 30\text{ sec}</m> is <m> 2.2\text{ m/s}^2</m>. If cheetah started out at rest, what will be (a) the distance traveled and (b)  speed at <m> t = 30\text{ sec}</m>? 
			</p>

		</statement>
		<hint> <p>  For both (a) and (b) use constant acceleration equations. </p> </hint>
		<answer> <p> 
		(a) <m> 990\text{ m} </m>, (b) <m> 66\text{ m/s} </m>.  </p> </answer>
		<solution> 
			<p> (a)
				Since <m> \Delta t</m> and <m> v_i </m> are given to us, the following equation will give the displacement.
				<me>
					\Delta x = v_{i,x}\Delta t + \dfrac{1}{2} a_{\text{av},x} (\Delta t)^2.
				</me>
				With the numerical values given, we get
				<me>
					\Delta x = 0 + \dfrac{1}{2} \times 2.2\times 30^2 = 990\text{ m}.
				</me>

			</p>
			<p> (b) 
				The velocity at the final instant can be obtained by
				<me>
					v_{f,x} = v_{i,x} +  a_{\text{av},x}\,  \Delta t  = 2.2\times 30 = 66\text{ m/s}.
				</me>
