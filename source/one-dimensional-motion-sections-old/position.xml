<section xml:id="oneD-Position-Displacement-and-Distance"><title>Position, Displacement, and Distance </title>
	<p>
		<term> Position </term> refers to the location of the object. If motion occurs only on the <m> x </m> axis, we use <m> x </m> coordinate of the object to locate it. More generally, we can use all the coordinates (<m>x, y, z </m>) for the point where the object is located if we need to describe motion in three-dimensional space. In motion in the <m>xy</m>-plane, we also use polar coordinates (<m> r, \theta </m>).
	</p>
	<p>
		<term> Displacement </term> is the change in position during an interval. Displacements along coordinates are denoted by <m> \Delta x, \Delta y, </m> and <m> \Delta z</m>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Suppose, an object moves from <m> x = x_i</m> at initial time <m> t_i </m> to <m> x = x_f</m> at final time <m> t_f </m>, then the displacement will be 
		<men>
				\Delta x = x_f - x_i.
		</men>			
	</p>

	<p> 
		<term> Distance </term> traveled refers to the length of the entire path of motion, not just the iunitial and final locations. This is usually denoted by <m> d </m>. The difference between displacement and distance is illustrated in <xref ref="Difference-between-Displacement-and-Distance" />.

		<statement>
			<p>
				A boy runs on a straight track, which is taken to be the <m> x </m> axis. As shown in <xref ref="fig-Difference-between-Displacement-and-Distance"/>, the boy is at <m> x = 5\text{ m} </m>  mark at <m> t = 2 \text{ sec} </m>. He runs to <m> x = 50\text{ m}</m> mark, reaching there at <m>t=10\text{ sec}</m>. He then turns around and runs back to <m> x = 20\text{ m}</m> mark arriving there at <m> t = 20 \text{ sec}</m>.

				(a) What is his displacement during the <m> t = 2 \text{ sec} </m> to <m> t = 20 \text{ sec} </m> interval?

		<hint> <p>  Displacement depends only on the initial and final locations and distance depends on the entirety of motion. </p> </hint>
		<answer> 
			<p> 
				(a) <m> \Delta x = 15\text{ m}</m>, 
				(b)  <m> d = 75\text{ m}</m>,
				(c) <m> \Delta x = 45\text{ m}</m>, 
				(d)  <m> d = 45\text{ m}</m>,
				(e) <m> \Delta x = -30\text{ m}</m>, 
				(f)  <m> d = 30\text{ m}</m>,				
			</p> 
		</answer>
		<solution> 
			<p>
				(a) The displacement on <m> x </m> axis is the change in the <m> x </m> coordinates.
				<me>
					\Delta x = 20\text{ m} - 5\text{ m} = 15\text{ m}.
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				(b) The distance traveled on path must take into account all the distance traveled. Here, the boy first ran <m> 50-5 = 45 \text{ m}</m> and then ran another <m> 50 - 20 = 30\text{ m} </m> on the return path.  We need to add them.
				<me>
					d = 45 \text{ m} +  30\text{ m} = 75\text{ m}.
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				(c)The displacement on <m> x </m> axis is the change in the <m> x </m> coordinates.
				<me>
					\Delta x = 50\text{ m} - 5\text{ m} = 45\text{ m}.
				</me>
			</p>
			<p> 
				(d)
				Since there is no turn in motion direction during this interval, the distance is equal to the magnitude of displacement.
				<me>
					d = 45\text{ m}.
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				(e)
				The displacement on <m> x </m> axis is the change in the <m> x </m> coordinates.
				<me>
					\Delta x = 20\text{ m} - 50\text{ m} = -30\text{ m}.
				</me>
			</p>
			<p> (f)
				Since there is no turn in motion direction during this interval, the distance is equal to the magnitude of displacement, stripping away the negative sign.
				<me>
					d = 30\text{ m}.
				</me>
			</p>
