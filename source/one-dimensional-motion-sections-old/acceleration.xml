<section xml:id="oneD-Acceleration"> <title> Acceleration </title>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			Study of the rate of change of position <m> x </m> gave us velocity <m> v_x</m>. We apply the same methods to study the rate of change of <m> v_x</m>. Therefore, we define an average acceleration and an instantaneous acceleration. For a motion on the <m> x </m> axis, we will denote instantaneous acceleration by symbol <m> a_x</m> and average acceleration by <m> a_{\text{av},x}</m>.

		</p>
	</introduction>



	<subsection><title> Average Acceleration</title>

		<p>
			The average rate of change of velocity during an interval from <m> t_i </m> to <m> t_f </m>  can be obtained by dividing the change in velocity by the interval. Let <m> v_{i,x} </m> be the velocity at <m> t_i</m> and  <m> v_{f,x} </m> be the velocity at <m> t_f</m>, then average acceleration, <m> a_{\text{av},x}</m>, will be
			<men>
				  a_{\text{av},x}  = \dfrac{v_{f,x} - v_{i,x}}{ t_f - t_i}.
			</men>
			We often write this as
			<me>
				a_{\text{av},x}  = \dfrac{\Delta v_x}{ \Delta t},
			</me>
			where <m> \Delta v_x = v_{f,x} - v_{i,x}</m> and <m>\Delta t = t_f - t_i</m>.
		</p>

	</subsection>


	<subsection><title> Instantaneous Acceleration</title>


		<p>
			Often we want acceleration <alert> at a particular instant</alert>. What we mean by this is the average acceleration between that instant, say <m> t </m> and an instant very close to <m> t</m>, e.g., a tiny amount of time later than <m> t</m>, which we can indicate by <m> t + \Delta t </m>. How close to <m> t </m> should the instant <m> t + \Delta t </m> be? The answer is as close to <m> t </m> as possible. This is the notion of infinetismal interval.
		</p>
		<p>
			Denoting the instantaneous acceleration for a motion along the <m> x </m> axis by the symbol <m> a_x </m>, we write this special averaging formally as
			<men xml:id="eq-instantaneous-acceleration-1d-limit">
				a_x = \dfrac{v_x\left(\text{at } (t+\Delta t)\right) - v_x\left(\text{at } t\right)}{\Delta t},
			</men> 
			for <m> t+\Delta t </m> as close to <m> t </m> as possible. Since <m> a_x </m> is a ratio of a change in <m> v_x </m> to a change in <m> t </m> it can be computed by <alert> the slope of <m> v_x </m> versus <m> t</m> plot</alert>.  
		</p>



	</subsection>


	<subsection> <title> Graphical Definition of Acceleration </title>


		<p>
			Since the slope of a function is the rate of change of that function, the rate of change of velocity at a particular instant can be obtained from the slope of the tangent of the velocity versus time plot. We can take this as defining acceleration <m> a_x </m> for one-dimensional motion on the <m> x </m> axis.
 
			<men>
				 a_x = \text{ slope of tangent to }v_x\text{ versus }t.
			</men>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			If the plot of <m> v_x </m> versus <m> t </m> is linear, i.e., a straight line, then the tangent line is same as the line of the plot, hence <m> a_x </m> is just the slope of the line. 
		</p>

			

		<figure xml:id="accln-positive-and-negative">
			<caption> 
				The slope of <m> v_x </m> versus <m> t </m> plot gives the acceleration <m> a_x </m>. Since the plot is linear, the slope is same for all instants plotted. In (a) <m> a_x = 1.0 \text{ m/s}^2</m> and in (b) <m> a_x = - 0.75 \text{ m/s}^2</m>.

		<p>
			But, if the  plot of <m> v_x </m> versus <m> t </m> is curved, then you would draw a tangent line at the instant of interest, and compute the slope of the tangent line to get <m> a_x </m>.

			<caption> 
				The slope of <m> v_x </m> versus <m> t </m> plot gives the acceleration <m> a_x </m>. Since the plot is not linear, we need to first draw a tangent line at the instant we want the acceleration value. The figure illustrates <m> a_x</m> at <m> t = 4\text{ sec}</m>, where the slope of the tangent line is <m>a_x = (4-(-1))/(5-3) = 2.5\text{ m/s}^2 </m>.

				<p>
					(a) The <m> v_x </m> versus <m> t</m> plot through the time when <m> t = 1\text{ sec}</m> is a straight line. Therefore, <m> a_x </m> will simply be slope of this part of the plot. The slope of this line is clearly zero. Therefore, <m> a_x (\text{at }t=1\text{ sec}) = 0</m>.
				</p>
				<p>
					(b) The <m> v_x </m> versus <m> t</m> plot through the time when <m> t = 3\text{ sec}</m> is a straight line. Therefore, <m> a_x </m> will simply be slope of this part of the plot. The slope of this line is obtained by picking two points on the line between <m> t = 2\text{ sec}</m> and <m> t = 3.5\text{ sec}</m>.

					(b) The <m> v_x </m> versus <m> t</m> plot through the time when <m> t = 3.75\text{ sec}</m> is a straight line. Therefore, <m> a_x </m> will simply be slope of this part of the plot.

		<p>
			We have learned that area under <m>v_x</m> versus <m>t</m> corresponds to change in <m>x</m>. Similarly, we can get <m>\
			Delta v_x</m> from area under the curve of <m>a_x</m> versus <m>t</m> as illustrated in <xref ref="fig-v-from-ax-vs-t-main-new" />.
		</p>
		<p>
			The area under the curve is the area between the graph and <m>a_x=0</m> line. Therefore, for positive <m>a_x</m> we get positive area and for negative <m>a_x</m> we get netative area.

				(a) From the area-under-curve we can find the change in <m> v_x </m> during <m> t= 0 </m> to <m> t = 1\text{ sec}</m>. Adding this change to the <m> v_x </m> at <m> t= 0</m> will give us the <m> v_x </m> at <m> t=1\text{ sec}</m>.
