		<problem><title> Two Runners in a Race - Relative Motion </title>
			<statement>
				<p> 
					Karl and Justin are in a <m>10\text{-km}</m> race. Karl runs at a constant speed of <m> 12\text{ km/h}</m> and Justin at <m> 11.5\text{ km/h}</m>. You can assume <m> t = 0 </m> at the start and their speeds are their full values at the start.
				</p>
				<p>
					(a) Who will finish the race first?
				</p>
				<p>
					(b) What is the value of time, <m> t </m>, when Karl finishes?
				</p>
				<p>
					(c) What is the value of time, <m> t </m>, when Justin finishes?
				</p>
				<p>
					(d) If Karl finishes first, how far away from the finish is Justin when Karl crosses the finish line, and if Justin finishes first, same question for Karl.
				</p>
				<p>
					(e) How far apart are the two runners after <m> 12\text{ min} </m>?
				</p>
			</statement>

			<hint> <p>  (a) Think who is faster? (b) Use <m> v = d/t</m>. (c) Same as (b). (d) Use d=vt on slower with t the finish time of the faster. (e) multiply the difference in their speeds by time. </p> </hint>
			
			<answer> <p>  (a) Karl, (b) <m> 50\text{ min}</m>, (c) <m> 52.17\text{ min}</m>, (d) <m> 0.417\text{ km}</m>, (e) <m> 100\text{ m}</m>.</p> </answer>
			
			<solution> 
				<p>
					(a) Since Karl's speed is greater, he will finish first.
				</p>
				<p>
					(b) Using <m> v = d/t </m> on Karl gives
					<me>
						t = \dfrac{d}{v} = \dfrac{10}{12}\text{ hr} = 50\text{ min}.
					</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					(c) Using <m> v = d/t </m> on Justin gives
					<me>
						t = \dfrac{d}{v} = \dfrac{10}{11.5}\text{ hr} = 52.17\text{ min}.
					</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					(d) Since Karl finishes at <m> t= 50\text{ min} </m>, Justin will have covered the following distance by then (note: I need to convert <m> 50\text{ min} = 5/6\text{ hr} </m> since the speed is given in per <m> \text{hr}</m> unit.)
					<me>
						d = vt = 11.5\times \dfrac{5}{6} = 9.583\text{ km}.
					</me>
					That means, the remaining distance is
					<me>
						10 - 9.583 = 0.417\text{ km}.
					</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					(e) Using <m> d = v t </m> with <m> v</m> being the difference of the two speeds. Also, since the speeds have time in <m> \text{hr}</m>, we need to convert <m> t</m> to <m> \text{hr} </m> as well. 
					<me>
						 d = (12-11.5)\times \dfrac{12}{60} = 0.1\text{ km} = 100\text{ m}.
					</me>
					You can also do this part by first finding how far Karl and Justin went, and then subtracting their distances.

We want <m>y</m> where they hit each other, i.e., <m>y_{1f} = y_{2f} = y</m>. Let <m> t</m> be the duration since ball 2 was launched. For the two equations we get

					(a) and (b):
				</p>
				<p>
					There are two constant-acceleration segments in this problem, such that final velocity and final position of the first segment is the initial velocity and initial position of the second segment. Let us denote the quantities of the first and second segments by subscripts 1 and 2, respectively.  
				</p>
				<p>
					We point positive <m> x </m> axis from the initial point of the first segment towards the final point where the puck comes to rest. Using this coordinate system, we have the following knowns and unknowns for segment 1.

					</md>
					The equation <m>v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2 a x </m> gives

					This gives

					Since the puck is moving in the same direction as the direction of the positive <m> x </m> axis, the positive root is the right choice here.

			<solution> 
				<p>
					(a) We would find velocity by integrating the acceleration, and then get the speed from the absolute value. The magnitude of acceleration drops from <m> g </m> to zero in time <m>\tau</m>. Therefore, we have the following formula for the magnitude of the acceleration at instant <m> t</m>.
					<me>
						a(t) = \dfrac{g}{\tau}\, t.
					</me>
					Let positive <m> y </m> axis be pointed up so that
					<me>
						a_y = -a(t) = - \dfrac{g}{\tau}\, t.
					</me>
					Now, we integrate this from <m> t = 0</m> to <m> t=t</m>. With <m> v_y=0</m> at <m> t = 0</m>.
					<men xml:id="eq-Varying-Acceleration-During-Parachute-Jump-vy">
						v_y(t) - 0 = \int_0^{t} a_y(t)\, dt = -\dfrac{g}{2\tau}\, t^2.
					</men>
					Therefore, speed at arbitrary instant is
					<me>
						v = \dfrac{g}{2\tau}\, t^2.
					</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					(b) Speed at instant <m> \tau</m> will be obtained by setting <m> t= \tau</m> in the answer for part (a).
					<me>
						v = \dfrac{1}{2} g\tau.
					</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					(c) Integrating <m> v_y(t) </m> will give <m>\Delta y</m>.
					<me>
						y(t) - 0 = \int_0^{\tau} v_y(t)\, dt = -\dfrac{g}{6\tau}\, \tau^3 = -\dfrac{1}{6 }\,g \tau^2.
					</me>
					The magnitude of this gives the distance fallen.
					<me>
						h = |y(t)| = \dfrac{1}{6 }\,g \tau^2.

		<problem><title> (Calculus) Varying Acceleration and Terminal Speed  </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Consider an object falling vertically. In a coordinate system with the positive <m> y </m> axis pointed down, the acceleration <m> a_y</m> has the following expression. Let <m> y=0</m> at <m> t=0</m>.
					<me>
						a_y = g - \gamma v_y,
					</me> 
					where <m> g </m> is acceleration due to gravity, and <m> \gamma </m> is a constant, called the damping constant.
				</p>
				<p>
					(a) Show that at the instant the acceleration is zero, the speed is
					<me>
						v = \dfrac{g}{\gamma}.
					</me>
					The speed is called the <term> terminal speed</term>. We will denote it by <m> v_T </m>.
				</p>
				<p>
					(b) Prove that velocity at arbitrary instant <m> t </m> is given by
					<me>
						v_y = v_T\left( 1 - e^{-\gamma\, t} \right).
					</me>
				</p>

				<p>
					(c) Prove that the <m> y </m> coordinate at arbitrary instant <m> t </m> is given by
					<me>
						y = v_T\, t - \dfrac{v_T}{\gamma}\left( 1 - e^{-\gamma\, t} \right).
					</me>
				</p>


			</statement>
			<hint> <p>  (a) Set <m> a_y=0</m>. (b) Write <m> a_y = dv_y/dt</m>, then change variable to  <m> k = -\gamma v_y + g </m> and integrate. (c) Integrate <m> v_y</m>. </p> </hint>
			<answer> <p>  Already given in problem statement. </p> </answer>
			<solution> 
				<p>(a)
					Setting <m> a_y=0</m> and <m> v_y = v_T </m>, we imediately get the answer.
					<me>
						v = \dfrac{g}{\gamma}.
					</me>				
				</p>
				<p>
					(b) We express <m> a_y = dv_y/dt</m> and rearrange to obtain
					<me>
						\dfrac{dv_y}{g - \gamma v_y} = dt.
					</me>
					Integrating this from <m> t=0</m> to <m> t =t</m> with <m>v_y(0)=0</m> and <m>v_y(t)=v_y</m>, we get
					<me>
						\ln\left( \dfrac{| g - \gamma v_y|}{g} \right)   = -\gamma t.
					</me>
					Since <m> g</m> is larger than <m>\gamma v_y </m>, exponentiating and then rearranging gives. 
					<me>
						v_y = \dfrac{g}{\gamma} \left( 1 - e^{-\gamma t}\right),
					</me>
					which is
					<me>
						v_y = v_T\left( 1 - e^{-\gamma\, t} \right).
					</me>					
				</p>
				<p>
					(c) Integrating <m> v_y</m> gives the desired answer.
					<me>
						\int dy = \int v_y dt.
					</me>
					Use <m> v_y </m> from (b) and carry out the integration.
					<me>
						y = v_T\, t - \dfrac{v_T}{\gamma}\left( 1 - e^{-\gamma\, t} \right).
