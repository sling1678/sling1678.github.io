    <title>Ideal Gas</title>

    <introduction>
    	<p>
    		Thermal response of gases are considerably different than that of liquids and solids. A simole model of ideal gas, called ideal gas, provides an important system for studying thermal properties of gases. In this chapter we will study ideal gas law and thermodynamic processes for gases.
