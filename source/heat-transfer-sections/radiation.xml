	<introduction>
		<p>

			Energy carried from one system to another by light and other electomagnetic waves is called <term> radiation</term>.  Unlike conduction or convection, energy exchange between two bodies by radiation can occur even across a vacuum between the two bodies. A spectacular evidence is the radiation from far away stars reaching the Earth.
		</p> 
		<p>
			The radiation mode of heat transfer is based on the fact that all materials above absolute zero temperature (<m>-273.15^{\circ}</m>C or zero degree kelvin) emit electromagnetic waves. We use a perfect emitter, called <term> black body</term>, to model radiation emitted by a body. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The total radiation emitted by an ideal black body at a given temperature <m> T</m> is given by the <term>  Stefan-Boltzmann law </term> in terms of the power radiated per unit surface area, the <term> power flux</term>.
			<men xml:id="eq-stefan-boltzmann-law-blackbody"> 
				\left(\dfrac{\text{Power}}{\text{Area}}\right) = \sigma\, T^4,
			</men>
			where <m> T</m> is in kelvin scale and <m>\sigma</m> is a universal constant called the <term>  Stefan-Boltzmann constant </term> with magnitude 
			<men>
				\sigma = 5.7\times 10^{-8} \text{W/m}^2\text{K}^4.
			</men>
			The power flux radiated by a real body is usullay smaller than given by Eq. <xref ref="eq-stefan-boltzmann-law-blackbody"/>. We take care of this by multiplying the result of Eq. <xref ref="eq-stefan-boltzmann-law-blackbody"/> by a factor, called the emissivity factor, denoted by <m> \epsilon </m>.
			<men xml:id="eq-stefan-boltzmann-law-all"> 
				\left(\dfrac{\text{Power}}{\text{Area}}\right) = \epsilon\,\sigma\, T^4,
			</men>
			with emissivity in the range, <m>0 \le \epsilon \le 1</m>.	Similar to emissivity of a body is absorptivity, <m>\alpha</m>. The ideal blackbody absorbs all radiation incident upon it, but real objects absorb only a part of it. The absorptivity is defined by
			<men>
				\text{Absorptivity, }\ \alpha = \dfrac{\text{Radiation absorbed}}{\text{Radiation incident}}.
			</men>
			To simplify calculations we often assume that the absorptivity of a material is equal to the emissivity.
			<men>
				\text{Simplifying assumption: }\ \ \alpha = \epsilon.
			</men>
			This relation is strictly true only for an ideal black body, where both are equal to 1, but for most materials, this relation can be taken as a starting point of analysis.  The absorptivity and emissivity are experimental quantities which we normally find by empirical means for each material.

		<statement>
			<p>
				The Sun radiates <m>4\times10^{26}\text{ J}</m> of energy per second.   Assuming that the radiation from the Sun is very close to that expected from a blackbody, and the radius of Sun to be <m>7.0 \times 10^8\text{ m}</m>, find the surface temperature of Sun.
			</p>

		</statement>
		<hint> <p>  Use Stefan-Boltzmann law. </p> </hint>
		<answer> <p> <m> 5,800\text{K}</m>.  </p> </answer>
		<solution> 
			<p>
				The amount of energy radiated per unit time per unit area, i.e., Power/Area, is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law.
				<me> 
					\left(\dfrac{P}{A}\right)_{\text{emitted}} = \sigma T^4.	
				</me>
				Here, the area is equal to the surface area of a sphere, which is <m>4\pi R^2</m>. Solving for <m>T</m>, we find
				<me>
					T = \left( \dfrac{P}{4\pi R^2  \sigma}\right)^{1/4}.
				</me>
				Now, we put values of <m>p</m>, <m>R</m> and <m>\sigma</m>  to obtain the following temperature at the surface of Sun.
				<me>
					T = \left( \dfrac{4.0\times 10^{26}\text{W}}{4\pi (7.0\times 10^8 \text{m})^2 (5.7\times 10^{-8} \text{W/m}^2\text{K}^4)}\right)^{1/4} = 5,800\text{K}.

		<p>
			The distribution of intensity of radiation with frequency for a blackbody, an ideal object that is both a perfect absorber  and a perfect emitter of radiation, is given by the <term> Planck radiation law</term>.  According to the Planck radiation law the power per unit area <m>d\Phi</m> in the radiation of frequencies between <m>f</m> and <m>f+df</m> is given by the following formula.
			<men xml:id="eq-Planck-law">
				d\Phi = \dfrac{2\pi h}{c^2}\dfrac{f^3}{\exp{\left(\dfrac{hf}{k_B T}\right)} - 1} df\ \ (0\le f \lt \infty) 
			</men>
			where <m>c (3 \times 10^8\ \text{m/s})</m> is the speed of light, <m>h (6.63\times 10^{-34} \text{J.s})</m> the {\bf Planck constant}\index{Planck constant} and <m>k_B (1.38 \times 10^{-23} \text{J/K})</m> the Boltzmann constant.  
		</p>
		<p>
			You can obtain the Stephan Boltzmann law from the Planck distribution, given in Eq. <xref ref="eq-Planck-law"/>, by integrating the later from <m>f = 0</m> to <m>\infty</m>.  Stephan-Boltzmann law gives an expression for the total radiation emitted by a blackbody.
