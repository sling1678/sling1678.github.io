	<title>Energy Transported by Plane Wave</title>
        <p>
            All waves transport energy without an actual transport of material. For concreteness, as shown in <xref ref="fig-intensity-definition"/> consider a wave of frequency <m>f</m>, wavelength <m>\lambda</m>, and amplitude <m>D</m> on a taut string with tension <m>T</m> and mass per unit length <m>\mu</m>. We denote the amplitude of the displacement of string particles by letter <m>D</m> rather than letter <m>A</m> since the later will be used for area below. Supposing the wave is moving in the positive <m>x</m> axis direction wave will have the following expression.
            <me>
                \psi = D \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} x - 2\pi f t\right).

                A wave passing through a cross-sectional area; intensity of the wave is defined as average power passing per unit are perpendicular to the wave direction.  The wave shown here has speed <m>v</m>.  The energy contained in the box of area <m>A_{\perp}</m> and height <m>v\Delta t</m> pass through <m>A_{\perp}</m> in time <m>\Delta t</m>.

        </figure>
        <p>
            In <xref ref="fig-intensity-definition"/>, the energy of the wave will be contained in the motion (kinetic energy) and the deformation (potential energy). Let us figure out the energy contained within a distance <m>v\Delta t</m> of the plane labeled <m>A_\perp</m> in the figure. Since each part of the string executes simple harmonic motion at frequency <m>f</m> of the wave, we can use formulas for energy derived in the simple harmonic motion to get some ideas about energy involved here.  Let <m>K</m> stand for effective spring constant (we use capital <m>K</m> to distinguish it from wavenumber <m>k</m>) and <m>M</m> the mass of string in length <m>v\Delta t</m>, where <m>v</m> is the wave speed. Let <m>V</m> denote maximum speed of motion of particles of string. Thus, average energy within a length <m>v\Delta t</m> of the string can be estimated to be 
            <men>
                E_\text{av} = \frac{1}{2} K D^2 = \frac{1}{2} M V^2
            </men>
            Additionally, by analogy with simple harmonic oscillator, we can replace <m>V</m> by
            <men>
                V = \omega D= 2\pi f D.
            </men>
            Using this we find 
            <men>
                K = M \omega^2 = 4\pi^2 M f^2.
            </men>
            Therefore,
            <men>
                E_\text{av} = \frac{1}{2} K D^2 =  2 \pi^2 M f^2 D^2.
            </men>
            This energy will pass any point of string in time <m>\Delta t</m>. Therefore, the average rate of flow of energy, i.e., average power <m>P</m>, in the string will be
            <mdn>
                <mrow number="no">P_\text{av} \amp = \frac{E_\text{av}}{\Delta t} = \frac{2 \pi^2 M f^2 D^2}{\Delta t}, </mrow>
                <mrow number="no"> \amp =  \frac{2 \pi^2 M v f^2 D^2}{v\Delta t} = 2 \pi^2 \mu v f^2D^2, </mrow>

            </mdn>
            This says that the rate at which energy is transported by a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave.
            <men>
                P_\text{av} \propto D^2.
            </men>

                        
        </p>    
            
        <p>

            It is of interest to know how <q>concentrated</q> the power is in any region. Therefore, we define a property called <term>intensity</term> of the wave by dividing power by the area of the surface the wave is flowing through, here it will be <m>A_\perp</m>. 
            <men xml:id="eq-definition-of-intensity">
                I = \frac{P_\text{av}}{A_\perp} = \frac{2 \pi^2 \mu \lambda f^3 D^2}{A_\perp}.
            </men>
            Imporant observation here again is that intensity of a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude.
            <men>
                I \propto D^2.
            </men>
            For a plane wave intensity does not change from one location to another or with time. This is not the case for spherical wave as we will see below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that <m>D</m> in Eq. <xref ref="eq-definition-of-intensity"/> has the units of length since it corresponds to displacement in its derivation. The unit of intensssity will be
            <me>
                \text{unit of } I = \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}} \times \frac{1}{\text{s}^3} \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{m}^2} = \frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}^2},

        <p>
            Imagine a point source that emits a wave isotropically in all directions. Sun is a good example of this type of a source. Since the wave spreads out in a three-dimensional space isotropically, i.e., without a preferred direction, the wave will be a spherical wave.

                Let <m>P_0</m> be the rate at which energy is input in the wave at the center. Then, in a duration <m>\Delta t</m>, an energy equal to <m>\Delta E = P_0\Delta t</m> will pass through both the surfaces at <m>r=r_1</m> and <m>r=r_2</m>. Dividing this energy by time <m>\Delta t</m> and the areas of corresponding surfaces we get the following for the intensities at the two surfaces.

            This suggests a simple rule to remember in the case of spherically spreading wave.

                    <mrow> A \amp = \sqrt{ \frac{2 k r^2 I}{\pi \rho\omega^3} } </mrow>
                    <mrow> \amp = \sqrt{ \frac{2\times 10 \times 0.25^2 \times 120}{\pi\times 1050\times 200^3} }  = 7.54\times 10^{-5}\text{ m}^2.</mrow>
