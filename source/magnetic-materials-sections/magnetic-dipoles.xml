			All magnets have North and South poles. Even the tiniest of magnets, an electron also has North and South poles. Thus, fundamental property of magnets is dipole moment, denoted as <m>\vec \mu</m>.

				We found before that a current loop also has a magnetic dipole moment. This observation gave us two equivalent ways to model microscopic magnetic dipole - (1) as a tiny magnet and (2) a tiny current loop.

<!-- 		<p>
			Magnetic dipoles are fundamental building blocks of all magnets since there are no particles with individual North or South poles. Thus, instead of positive and negative charges, the fundamental property of a magnet is the magnetic dipole moment. We denote magnetic dipole moment by the Greek letter <m>\mu</m>.
		</p>
		<p>
			When a magnetic dipole is placed in an external magnetic field, its dipole moment will tend to aling with the direction of the external magnetic field. We use this to assign direction to magnetic dipole moment vector, <m>\vec \mu</m>. Since <q>South-pole</q> end of the dipole will face the North pole of the external field, dipole moment direction is said to be from the South-pole end to the North-pole end.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have seen in previous chapters that a magnetic dipole can be thought of as a loop of current.   <alert> To represent a magnetic dipole <m>\vec \mu</m> by a loop of current </alert> we envision a loop of current such that the product of the current and the area of the loop is equal to the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment as illustrated in <xref ref="fig-magnetic-dipole-vs-current-loop-mag-materials"/>.   The direction of the current is such that when you look at the loop from the direction of the tip of the dipole moment the current goes in counterclockwise sense. 
		</p>

				   Two equivalent pictures of an infinitesimal current loop: either think of the current loop as current loop or a magnetic dipole of magnetic dipole moment <m>\mu=IA</m> in the direction as displayed here. The exact equivalence occurs in the limit <m>A\rightarrow 0</m> and <m>I\rightarrow\infty</m> while keeping their product fixed, <m>IA = \mu</m>. The equivalent loop is shown as a circle here, but it can be any shape. Often it is easier for calcuation to use a square loop.

 		<p>
 			When we represent a magnetic dipole by a fictitious current loop, the current in the model loop is called <term> bound current</term> to distinguish them from current flowing in a conductor, which is called <term>free current</term>. Bound current model of magnetic dipole helps with calculations involving magnets.

	<subsection> <title> Force on a Magnetic Dipole in a Uniform Magnetic Field</title>

		<p>
			We wish to find magnetic force on a magnetic dipole as shown in <xref ref="fig-force-on-a-dipole-uniform"/>(a). First we replace magnetic dipole by a square loop of current, as shown in (b) of the figure, and find magnetic force on that equivalent current loop.

			</caption>
			<image source="./images/magnetic-materials/force-on-a-dipole-uniform.png" width="80%"/>	
		</figure>
		<p>
			By using the force law for current in uniform magnetic field
			<me>
				\vec F = I \vec L \times \vec B,
			</me>
			it is easy to show that forces on the opposite sides are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Hence,
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp \vec F_\text{qr} + \vec F_\text{sp} = 0,</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \vec F_\text{pq} + \vec F_\text{rs} = 0. </mrow>
			</md>
			Therefore,
			<me>
				\vec F_\text{current loop} = 0.
			</me>
			From this result we can deduce the answer to the original problem by taking the following special type of limits.
			<me>
				A\rightarrow 0\text{ and } I\rightarrow\infty\text{ keeping the product } IA \text{ fixed.}
			</me>
		</p>
		<p>
			Clearly, taking these limits does not change the result of zero net force.  
			Hence, we conclude that the magnetic force on the dipole in a uniform magnetic field is zero.
			<me>
				F_\text{dip} = 0. \text{ (uniform magnetic field)}
			</me>

	<subsection><title> Torque on a Magnetic Dipole in a Uniform Magnetic Field </title>
		<p>
			Even though the net force on a magnetic dipole in a uniform magnetic field is zero, the torque on the dipole is not zero if magnetic dipole moment is pointed at an angle to the magnetic field as in <xref ref="fig-force-on-a-dipole-uniform"/> as we will show now.  
		</p>
		<p>
			We will find torque of these force about axis through the center of the loop and perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field as shown in <xref ref="fig-torque-on-a-dipole-uniform"/>. 
		</p>			
		<p>
			Let <m>\theta</m> be the angle between the magnetic dipole moment vector <m>\vec \mu</m> and external magnetic field <m>\vec B</m> as in <xref ref="fig-torque-on-a-dipole-uniform"/>(a), which would mean normal to the equivalent square loop, pqrsp, will make this angle with magnetic field. 
		</p>


		<figure xml:id="fig-torque-on-a-dipole-uniform">
			<caption>
				Torque on a dipole in a uniform magnetic field is computed by torque of forces on the equivalent current loop. The axis is perpendicular to the direction of <m>\vec B</m> and passes through the center of the square loop of side <m>a</m>. The torques of <m>\vec F_\text{qr}</m> and <m>\vec F_\text{sp}</m> are both zero. The torques of <m>\vec F_\text{pq}</m> and <m>\vec F_\text{rs}</m> are nonzero and can be computed from the figure on the right. The magnitude of net torque equald <m>\tau = I a^2 B \sin\,\theta = \mu B \sin\,\theta</m>.
			</caption>
			<image source="./images/magnetic-materials/torque-on-a-dipole-uniform.png" width="80%"/>	
		</figure>

		<p>
			Since lines of forces <m>\vec F_\text{qr}</m> and <m>\vec F_\text{sp}</m> pass through the axis, their lever arms are zero; hence, their torques about this axis are zeros.  
		</p>
		<p>
			To find the torques from <m>\vec F_\text{pq}</m> and <m>\vec F_\text{rs}</m>, it is helpful to draw another figure from the perspective of looking down the axis. With <m>a</m> the length of a side of the square loop, we get lever arm for these forces to be <m>\dfrac{a}{2}\sin\,\theta</m>. The two forces have the same magnitude <m>IaB</m>. Their directions are also same, which is into the page. Therefore net torque  on the equivalnet current loop is 
			<me>
				\tau  = 2IaB\times \dfrac{a}{2}\sin\,\theta = Ia^2 B \sin\,\theta,
			</me>
			in the direction into the page, i.e., towards the negative <m>z</m> axis. Here area of the loope is <m> A = a^2</m>. Writing torque in the vector notations, we get the <m>z</m> component of torque to be
			<men xml:id="eq-torque-on-square-current-loop">
				\vec \tau = -\hat u_z \, IA B \sin\,\theta.
			</men>
			From this result we can deduce the answer to the original problem by taking the following special type of limits.
			<me>
				A\rightarrow 0\text{ and } I\rightarrow\infty\text{ keeping the product } IA \text{ fixed.}
			</me>
			It is readily seen that as soon as we replace <m>IA</m> by <m>\mu</m>, the limit is trivial and gives us the following for torque on the original dipole.
			<me>
				\vec \tau_\text{dip} =   -\hat u_z \, \mu B \sin\,\theta.
			</me>
			We can write this in terms of vectors <m>\vec \mu</m> and <m>\vec B</m>.

	<subsection><title> (Calculus) Force on a Magnetic Dipole in a Nonuniform Magnetic Field</title>
		<p>
			Consider a magnetic dipole in a nonuniform magnetic field. Rather than do the most general case, let the direction of the external magnetic field be fixed in the positive <m>y</m> direction with magnitude varying only as a function of <m>x</m> as indicated in <xref ref="fig-force-on-a-dipole-non-uniform"/>

			Now, we see that forces along <m>x</m> axis, viz., <m>\vec F_\text{qr}</m> and <m>\vec F_\text{sp}</m>, cancel. 
			<me>
				\vec F_\text{qr} + \vec F_\text{sp} = 0,
			</me>
			but forces in the <m>x</m> axis, viz., <m>\vec F_\text{pq}</m> and <m>\vec F_\text{rs}</m>, do not cancel due to different values of magnetic field at the two sides. The resulting <m>x</m> component of the net force on the equivalnet current loop is

		<sidebyside widths="70% 10% 20%">
			<p>
				The potential energy of a dipole <m>\vec \mu</m> in an external magnetic field <m>\vec B</m> depends upon its orientation with respect to the field. When the dipole makes an angle <m>\theta</m> with respect to the field, potential energy is given by

		<p>
			This says that the potential energy is minimum when the dipole is parallel to the field and maximum when antiparallel. We can deduce this result by using Calculus as I show next.
		</p>	
		

		<p> <alert> (Calculus) Derivation of Potential Energy. </alert>
			Since magnetic force is a conservative force, we expect magnetic force <m>\vec F</m> to be related to a potential energy function <m>U</m> by the gradient.

		<statement>
			<p>
				A dipole of moment <m>3 \times 10^{-10} \text{A.m}^2</m> is placed inside a long solenoid of 2000 turns per meter such that dipole is directed perpendicular to the axis of the solenoid.  Determine the force and torque on the dipole when a <m>8\ A</m> current is passed through the solenoid.

		</statement>
		<hint> <p> Use definition.  </p> </hint>
		<answer> <p> <m>|\vec \tau| = 6\times 10^{-12}\ \text{N.m}</m>.  </p> </answer>
		<solution> 
			<p>
				The magnetic field inside a cylindrical solenoid is pointed parallel to the axis and has the following magnitude.   
				<me>
					B = \mu_0\:n\:I = 4\pi\times 10^{-7}\times 2000\times 8 = 0.02\; \text{T}.
				</me>
				Since the magnetic field is uniform, there will be no net force on the dipole. Even though there would be no net force on the dipole, there may be a torque on the dipole  since the dipole is neither parallel nor antiparallel to the magnetic field.  The magnitude of torque is given by
				<me>
					\tau = \mu\:B\:\sin\:\theta = 3 \times 10^{-10}\: \text{A.m}^2\times  0.02\: \text{T}\times 1= 6\times 10^{-12}\:\text{Nm}.
				</me>
				The direction of the torque is perpendicular to both <m>\vec \mu</m> and <m>\vec B</m>.  It is given by the right-hand rule applied to the cross-product <m>\vec \mu\times \vec B</m>.
