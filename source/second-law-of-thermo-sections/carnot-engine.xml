	<introduction>
		<p>
			In a Carnot engine a fixed amount of ideal gas is heated and cooled in a particular cyclic process called the <term> Carnot cycle</term>. The Carnot cycle consists of four steps shown in <xref ref="fig-carnot-engine"/>.
			<ol>
				<li> Isothermal <alert> expansion</alert> at high temperature <m> T_H</m>.</li>
				<li> Adiabatic <alert> expansion </alert> lowering temperature from <m> T_H</m> to <m> T_C</m>.</li>
				<li> Isothermal <alert> compression</alert> at lower temperature <m> T_C</m>. </li>
				<li> Adiabatic <alert> compression </alert> raising temperature from <m> T_C</m> to <m> T_H</m>.</li>
			</ol>
			The states A, B, C, and D are chosen so that at the end of these four steps, the system returns to state A.

		<p>
			Since the system is an ideal gas and the processes are all quasi-static it is possible to work out heat and work in each step as we will show below.  These calculations show that the ratio of <m> Q_C </m> to <m> Q_H </m>  is equal to the ratio of the temperatures of the baths in absolute scale.
			<men xml:id="eq-carnot-funda-1">
				\dfrac{Q_C}{Q_H} = \dfrac{T_C}{T_H}\ \ \text{(temperatures in kelvin scale)} 
			</men>
			This relation can also used to define the absolute or kelvin scale of temperature from an operational viewpoint. Using this equaiton we can deduce the following for  the efficiency of a Carnot engine.
			<men xml:id="eq-carnot-funda-2"> 
				\eta_{\text{Carnot}}= 1-\dfrac{T_C}{T_H}\ \ \text{(temperatures in absolute/Kelvin scale)} 
			</men>
			This formula for the efficiency of a Carnot engine says that a Carnot engine will be 100% efficient only if the temperature of the cold bath <m> T_C </m> were zero degree kelvin.
		</p> 
		<p>
			When this observation on the efficiency of the Carnot engine is combined with the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law, we can conclude that a temperature of zero degree kelvin is not reachable since that would imply a possibility of constructing a thermal engine that has 100% efficiency. This gives another way to state the second law of thermodynamics.

	<subsection><title>Proof of <m>Q_C/Q_H = T_C/T_H</m> in Carnot Cycle </title>
		<p>
			Since the internal energy of an ideal gas is proportional to temperature, the internal energy does not change in the processes AB and CD in <xref ref="fig-carnot-engine"/>. Applying first law of thermodynamics to these steps and using the formula for work by a gas in an isothermal process, we conclude
			<mdn>
				<mrow xml:id="eq-qh-qc-1"> \amp Q_H = W_{AB} = nRT_H \ln\left( \frac{V_B}{V_A} \right) </mrow>
				<mrow xml:id="eq-qh-qc-2"> \amp Q_C = W_{CD} = nRT_H \ln\left( \frac{V_D}{V_C} \right) </mrow>
			</mdn>
			From the adiabatic processes BC and DA we have the following relations.
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp \textrm{BC process:  } T_H V_B^{\gamma-1} = T_C V_C^{\gamma-1}</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \textrm{DA process:  } T_H V_A^{\gamma-1} = T_C V_D^{\gamma-1}</mrow>
			</md>
			Taking the ratio we find
			<men xml:id="eq-qh-qc-3">
				\frac{V_B}{V_A} = \frac{V_C}{V_D}. 
			</men>
			Now, we take the ratio of Eq. <xref ref="eq-qh-qc-2"/> to Eq. <xref ref="eq-qh-qc-1"/> and use Eq. <xref ref="eq-qh-qc-3"/> to obtain the required result.

	<exercise xml:id="ex-The-Efficiency-of-a-Carnot-Engine"><title> The Efficiency of a Carnot Engine </title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				A Carnot engine operates between <m>400^{\circ}\text{C}</m> and <m>27^{\circ}\text{C}</m>.  
			</p>
			<p>
				(a) What is the efficiency of the Carnot engine?  
			</p>
			<p>
				(b) If the Carnot engine produces 5 kJ of work in each cycle, how much heat must it absorb from the <m>400^{\circ}\text{C}</m> bath in each cycle. 
			</p>
		</statement>
		<hint> <p>  (a) Make sure you express temperature in kelvin scale. (b) Use the efficiency found in the efficiency for arbitrary heat engine. </p> </hint>
		<answer> <p> (a) 55.4%, (b) <m> 9.03\ \text{kJ}</m>.  </p> </answer>
		<solution> <title> (a) </title>
			<p>
				(a) The efficiency of a Carnot engine can be written in terms of temperatures of the hot and cold baths. But, there is a catch. In order to make use of the formula for efficiency in terms of temperatures, we must express the temperatures in absolute scale.
				<md>
					<mrow>\amp T_H = 400 + 273.15 = 673.15\text{K} </mrow>
					<mrow>\amp T_C = 27 + 273.15 = 300.15\text{K}</mrow>
				</md>

				Therefore, the efficiency of the Carnot engine is
				<me>
					\eta = 1- \dfrac{T_C}{T_H} = 1 - \dfrac{300.15\text{K}}{673.15\text{K}} = 0.554.
				</me>
				The efficiency in this formula is written as fraction.  Normally, we write the number in percentage by multiplying this number by 100.  This gives the efficiency of this engine to be 55.4%.

			</p>
		</solution>
		<solution> <title> (b) </title>
			<p>
				(b) We can use the efficiency found to figure out the heat in the engine.
				<me>
					\text{Since }\eta = \dfrac{W}{Q_H},\ \ Q_H = \dfrac{W}{\eta} = \dfrac{5\ \text{kJ}}{0.554} = 9.03\ \text{kJ}.

		<statement>
			<p>
				A Carnot engine operating in a Carnot cycle between <m>400^{\circ}\text{C}</m> and an unknown lower temperature has an efficiency of <m>0.3</m>.  How much heat must be rejected to the cold bath for every kJ of heat absorbed from the hot bath.		

			</p>

		</statement>
		<hint> <p>  Use <m> Q_H = 1\text{ kJ}</m> in <m>\eta = (1-Q_C/Q_H) </m>. </p> </hint>
		<answer> <p> <m>0.7\text{kJ}</m>.  </p> </answer>
		<solution> 
			<p>
				The efficiency of the Carnot engine can be expressed in terms of <m> Q_C</m> and <m> Q_H</m> alone.
				<me>
					\eta_C =  \frac{Q_H-Q_C}{Q_H}\ \ \Longrightarrow\ \ Q_C = (1-\eta_C) Q_H.
				</me>
				Therefore, if <m> Q_H = 1\text{ kJ}</m>, then
				<me> 
					Q_C = (1-0.3) \times 1\ \text{kJ} = 0.7\ \text{kJ}.

	<exercise xml:id="ex-Power-of-a-Carnot-Engine"><title>  Power of a Carnot Engine </title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				A Carnot engine working between two heat baths of temperatures <m>600\text{K}</m> and <m>273\text{K}</m> completes each cycle in <m>5\text{ sec}</m>.  In each cycle, the engine absorbs <m>10\text{ kJ}</m> of heat.  Find the power of the engine.
			</p>

		</statement>
		<hint> <p> Find <m>\eta</m> from temperatures and then use it to get <m>W</m> and <m>P=W/\Delta t</m>.  </p> </hint>
		<answer> <p> <m>2,400\text{ W}</m>.  </p> </answer>
		<solution> 
			<p>
				The power <m>P</m> of the engine will be work <m>W</m> divided by time <m>\Delta t</m>.
				<me>
					P = \frac{W}{\Delta t}.
				</me>
				From the definition of efficiency we can obtain <m>W</m> from the heat rejected to the lower temperature bath and the efficiency as follows.
				<me>
					\eta = \frac{W}{Q_H} =  \frac{W}{W-Q_C}\ \ \Longrightarrow\ \ W = \left( \frac{\eta}{1-\eta}\right)\ Q_C.
				</me>
				The efficiency here is equal to the efficiency of the Carnot cycle.
				<me>
					\eta = 1- \frac{T_C}{T_H}\ \ \Longrightarrow\ \ \frac{\eta}{1-\eta} = \frac{T_H-T_C}{T_C}.
				</me>
				Putting in the values here
				<me>
				 	\frac{\eta}{1-\eta} = \frac{600-273}{273} = 1.2.
				</me>
				Therefore,
				<me>
					W = 1.2\times\ Q_C = 1.2\times 10\ \text{kJ} = 12\ \text{kJ}.
				</me>
				This work is done in 5 sec. Therefore, the power is
				<me>
					P = \frac{W}{\Delta t} = \frac{12\ \text{kJ}}{5\ s} =  2400\ \text{W}.
