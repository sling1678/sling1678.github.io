	<introduction>
        <p>
        	We can also find the location, orientation, and size of image algebraically rather than by drawing rays. First I will work out formulas that connect object distance, image distance, and radius of curvature of concave mirror. Then we will work out a similar formula for convex mirror. We will see that we can write one relation that will cover both cases if we follow a sign convention.

    <subsection><title>Concave Mirror Equation</title>
    	<p>
    		Consider an object OP located at a distance from a concave mirror so that a real image forms on a screen in front of the mirror as shown in <xref ref="fig-concave-mirror-equation-setup"/>. Although, I will work out a formula for the real image, the same formula will also work for a virtual image with appropriate sign convenstion.

 				   Image by a concave mirror of a point P that is not on the axis. An off-axis point is chosen so that we can also study the vertical size of the image. We draw two special rays to find its image Q. Point O of the object will fall on the axis at I. Points Y and S are labeled since we will use them in calculations.

			We will refer all horizontal distances from vertex V and all vertical distance from the optical axis OIV. Let <m>R</m> be the radius of the mirror. First notice that upon comparing the angles in triangles <m>\triangle\text{OPV}</m>  and  <m>\triangle\text{IQV}</m>, we find that these trinagles form a pair of similar triangles. Therefore, from plane geometry we can state that their corresponding sides must be proportional.
			<men xml:id="eq-reflection-1">
				\frac{\text{VO}}{ \text{VI} } = \frac{ \text{OP} }{ \text{IQ} }.
			</men>
			Similarly, try to establish that  triangles <m>\triangle\text{OPF}</m>  and  <m>\triangle\text{SFY}</m> are similar. That will give us the following relation.
			<men xml:id="eq-reflection-2">
				\frac{\text{FO}}{ \text{SY} } = \frac{ \text{OP} }{ \text{FS} }.
			</men>			
			By construction, we also have 	
			<men xml:id="eq-reflection-3">
				\text{IQ} = \text{FS}. 
			</men>
			In our calculations, we will assume that the rays make small angle with the optical axis. This is called  <term>  paraxial approximation</term>.  Paraxial rays make small angle, e.g.,  <m>\theta  = \angle\text{PVQ}</m> at the vertex, therefore we can make the follpwing approximations
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp \sin\theta \approx \tan\theta  \approx  \theta.</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \cos\theta  \approx 1.</mrow>
			</md>
			Using these approximations we will also have the following important relation.
			<men xml:id="eq-reflection-4">
				\text{SY} \approx \text{VF}. 
			</men>
			From Eqs. <xref ref="eq-reflection-1"/>  to <xref ref="eq-reflection-4"/>, we can deduce the following
			<men xml:id="eq-reflec-concave-5">
				\frac{\text{VO} }{ \text{VI} } = \frac{ \text{FO} }{ \text{VF} }.  
			</men>
			Since <m>\text{FO} = \text{VO} - \text{VF}</m>, we get the following after using this and then dividing both sides by <m>\text{VO} </m>, and then rearranging terms.
			<men  xml:id="eq-concave-mirror-equation">
				\frac{ 1 }{ \text{VO} } + \frac{ 1 }{ \text{VI} }  = \frac{ 1 }{ \text{VF} }. 
			</men>
			We now define symbols <m>p</m>, <m>q</m>, and <m>f</m> to represent the geometric distances as follows.
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp p = \text{VO} = \text{object distance}, </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp q = \text{VI} = \text{image distance}, </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp f = \text{VF} = \text{image distance} = \frac{R}{2}. </mrow>
			</md>
			Note that the distance <m>\text{VF}</m> is equal to half the radius of the curvature of the mirror. That is, focal length of a concave mirror is
			<men xml:id="concave-mirror-focal-length">
				f = \frac{R}{2}.  
			</men>				
			Using these symbols, Eq. <xref ref="eq-concave-mirror-equation"/> takes the following familiar form, which we will refer to as <term>concave mirror equation</term>.
			<men xml:id="eq-concave-mirror-equation-2">
				\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q}  = \frac{1}{f}, 
			</men>
				
		</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection><title>Size and Orientation of Image</title>
		<p>
			Refer to <xref ref="fig-concave-mirror-equation-setup"/> for the drawing of image formation in a concave mirror. 
			To study the size and orientation of the image compared to the object we can study the heights of the object and image points with respect to the symmetry axis. Let height above the axxis be positive and that below the axis be negative. Let
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp h_o = \text{OP} = \text{object height}, </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp h_i = -\text{IQ} = \text{object height},  </mrow>
			</md>
			where note the negative sign to make <m>h_i</m> negative by multiplying the positive length <m>\text{IQ}</m> to negative height corresponding to our drawing in <xref ref="fig-concave-mirror-equation-setup"/>. Now, from similar triangles <m>\triangle\text{OPV}</m> and <m>\triangle\text{IQV}</m> we find
 			<me>
 				\frac{ \text{IQ} }{ \text{OP} } = \frac{ \text{IV} }{ \text{OV} }
 			</me>
 			Therefore,
 			<men>
 				\frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{q}{p}.
 			</men>
 			The ration <m>h_i/h_o</m> gives both the relative size and relative orientation of the image with respect to the object. It is called <term>magnifcation</term>, or more accurately <term>transverse magnification</term> since the heights are perpendicular to the axis and not along the axis, of the image and denoted by <m>m_T</m>, or sometimes simply by <m>m</m>.
 			<men>
 				m_T = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{q}{p}.
 			</men>
 			Thus, if <m>m_T</m> is positive, then image has the same orientation as the object and if it is negative the image is inverted. If   <m>|m_T| \gt 1</m> ,then image is larger than the object, i.e., magnified, and if <m>|m_T| \lt 1</m>,  then image is smaller than the object, i.e., shrunk.

    </subsection>

    <subsection><title>Virtual Image by a Concave Mirror</title>
    	<p>
    		When we use the concave mirror equation <xref ref="eq-concave-mirror-equation"/> for an object that is within a focal length, i.e., <m>p \lt R/2 </m>, then we find that <m>q</m> is negative.
    		<me>
    			\frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{R/2} - \frac{1}{p} = \frac{p - R/2}{ pR/2} \lt 0\ \text{ if }\ p\lt R/2. 
    		</me>
    		The negative value of <m>q</m> would correspond to distance of the virtual image behind the mirror at a distance <m>|q|</m> from the vertex.

			<p>
				Real image from a concave mirror is inverted. Therefore, we take <m>h_i = -2\text{ cm}</m> and <m>h_o = 3\text{ cm}</m>. This gives
				<me>
					-\frac{q}{p} = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{2}{3}.

				This can be solved easily to get <m>p = 25\text{ cm}</m>. First factor out <m>1/p</m>, then the factor multiplying <m>1/p</m> will be <m>5/6</m>, which can be sent to the other side and simplified.

    	</p>
	 	<figure xml:id="fig-convex-mirror-equation-setup">
 			<caption>
 				   Image by a convex mirror of a point P that is not on the axis. An off-axis point is chosen so that we can also study the vertical size of the image.

		<p>
			As for the concave mirror, we will refer all horizontal distances from vertex V and all vertical distance from the optical axis OIV. First notice that upon comparing the angles in triangles <m>\triangle\text{OPF}</m>  and  <m>\triangle\text{YVF}</m>, we find that these trinagles form a pair of similar triangles. Therefore, from plane geometry we can state that their corresponding sides must be proportional.
			<men xml:id="eq-convex-mirror-equation-1">
				\frac{ \text{OF} }{ \text{VF} } = \frac{\text{OP}}{ \text{VY} }.
			</men>
			Similarly, try to establish that  triangles <m>\triangle\text{OPV}</m>  and  <m>\triangle\text{IQV}</m> are similar. That will give us the following relation.
			<men xml:id="eq-convex-mirror-equation-2">
				\frac{ \text{VO} }{ \text{VI} } = \frac{\text{OP}}{ \text{IQ} }.

			In paraxial approximation, <m> \text{VY} \approx \text{IQ}</m>. Therefore, we will have
			<me>
				\frac{ \text{OF} }{ \text{VF} } = \frac{ \text{VO} }{ \text{VI} }.

			Now, from the figure, we notice that
			<me>
				\text{OF} = \text{OV} + \text{VF} =  \text{VO} + \text{VF}.

			Therefore,

			Simplifying this equation we get
			<me>
				\frac{ 1 }{ \text{VO} } + \frac{ 1 }{ \text{VF} } = \frac{ 1 }{ \text{VI} }.

			Let's rearrange this equation so that object and image distance are on one side of the equation.
			<men xml:id="eq-convex-mirror-equation-3">

				Equation <xref ref="eq-convex-mirror-equation-using-radius"/> for the convex mirror  differs from the concave equation, Eq. <xref ref="eq-concave-mirror-equation-2"/> in signs of image distance and focal length. We can write both the concave mirror equation and the convex mirror equation in the same form but with a sign convention.
