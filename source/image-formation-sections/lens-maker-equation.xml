	<introduction>
        <p>
        	In <xref ref="section-thin-lens-equation"/> we stated that object distance <m>p</m>, image distance <m>q</m> and focal length <m>f</m> are related by
        	<me>
        		\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{f}.
        	</me>
        	Focal length is a property of the lens and the media around the lens, being positive for convex lens and negative for concave lens. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	It is possible to find an expression for the focal length in terms of the radii <m>R_1</m> and <m>R_2</m> of the two refracting surfaces of the lens, the refractive index <m>n_0</m> of the medium in which lens will be placed, and the refractive index <m>n_l</m> of the material of the lens (see <xref ref="fig-lens-maker-equation-geometry-for-focal-length"/>). If we ignore the thickness <m>d</m> of the lens, the formula for the inverse of the focal length is
        	<men xml:id="eq-focal-length-in-terms-of-radii">
        		\frac{1}{f} =  \left( \frac{n_l - n_0}{n_0}   \right)  \left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right).
    		</men>
    		This equation is called the <term>lensmaker's equation</term>. By sign convention of refraction from a curved surface, the radius is positive if the center falls on the right of the vertex and negative when it falls on the left.

    		If the lens is operating in air, then with <m>n_0=1</m>, this formula will simplify.

    		</men>
    		Even the formula with thickness  <m>d</m> is not too complicated for lens in air.

	<exercise xml:id="exercise-Carving-a-Bi-Concave-Lens-for-a-Given-Focal-Length"><title>Carving a Bi-Concave Lens for a Given Focal Length</title>

		<statement>
			<p>
				Suppose you have been asked to make a bi-concave lens of focal length <m>-20\text{ cm}</m> in air. 
			</p>
			<p>
				(a) Find the radius of curvature of a symmetrically ground biconcave lens from a glass of refractive index <m>1.55</m> assuming you can ignore the thickness of the lens.
			</p>
			<p>
				(b) If the lens is used underwater, what will be refractive index of the lens then?
			</p>


		</statement>
		<hint><p>(a) Use thin lensmaker's equation for air. (b) Use general thin lensmaker's equation. Note that <m>R_1 \lt 0</m> and <m>R_2 \gt 0</m>. </p></hint>
		<answer><p>(a) <m> 22\text{ cm}</m>, (b) <m> 66.7\text{ cm}</m>. </p></answer>
		<solution><title>(a)</title>
			<p>
				In a biconcave lens, the radii will have the following signs: <m>R_1 \lt 0</m>, and <m>R_2 \gt 0</m>. You can convince yourself by drawing a picture and applying the sgn convention. Now, here <m>|R_1|=|R_2|</m>. Lets use a common symbol <m>x \gt 0</m> for this absolute value in Eq. <xref ref="eq-focal-length-in-terms-of-radii-in-air"/>. Therefore,
				<me>
					R_1 = -x,\ \ R_2 = x.
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				I will work in <m>\text{cm}</m> units for the length.

				<me>
					\frac{1}{-20} =  \left(  1.55 - 1   \right)  \left(-\frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{x} \right) = -\frac{0.55\times 2}{x} = \frac{1.1}{x}.
				</me>
				Therefore
				<me>
					x = 1.1\times 20 = 22\text{ cm}.
				</me>
			</p>
		</solution>
		<solution><title>(b)</title>
			<p>
				With <m>R_1=-22\text{ cm} = -R_2</m> and <m>n_0=1.33</m> in Eq. <xref ref="eq-focal-length-in-terms-of-radii"/>, we get
				<md>
					<mrow> \frac{1}{f} \amp = \left( \frac{n_l - n_0}{n_0}   \right)  \left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right)</mrow>
					<mrow> \amp = \left( \frac{1.55 - 1.33}{1.33}   \right)  \times \frac{2}{-22}</mrow>
					<mrow> \amp = -\frac{0.33}{22}</mrow>
				</md>
				Therefore, <m>f = 66.7\text{ cm}</m>.

	<!-- <subsection><title>Derivation of the Thin Lens Equation</title>
    	<p>
    		Suppose we have a lens of a material of refractive index <m>n_2</m>. Let <m>n_1</m> be the refractive index of the medium around the lens. Let <m>d</m> be the width of the lens at the center. Let <m>R_1</m> be the radius of curvature of the surface facing the light source and <m>R_2</m> the radius of curvature of the other surface  as shown in <xref ref="fig-lens-maker-equation-setup"/>.

    	<p>
    		Place a point light source P at a distance <m>p</m> from the vertex of the lens.  When you trace rays from P that strike the lens near the center of the lens, you find that when they emerge on the other side, they will pass through point Q if point P is sufficiently far away. Therefore, point Q is the image of this point. Let <m>q</m> be the distance of Q from the second vertes of the lens. Then, we will show that if <m>d \lt\lt |R|</m>, where <m>R</m> is smaller of the two radii of curvatures, so that we can ignore the thickness of the lens, then 
    		<men xml:id="eq-lens-maker-equation">
 
				\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = \left( \frac{n_2}{n_1}  - 1  \right) \left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right).
 
    		</men>
    		This equation is called the <term>lens maker equation</term>. You can see the right side only has properties of the media and the lens, and has the unit of inverse length. We denote the right side as <m>1/f</m>.
