			<statement>
				<p>
					A <m>30\text{-kg}</m> box on a smooth floor is attached to a spring of spring constant <m>100\text{ N/m}</m> and pulled horizontally by an increasing force <m> F </m> until the point when the box starts to slide.

			<answer> <p> <m> 0.161\text{ m}. </m> </p> </answer>
			<solution> 
				<p> We start by identifying forces on the block as in <xref ref="fig-bc-balancing-spring-force-by-static-friction-solution"/>. Note that static friction has its maximum value at the instant of interest.

				<p>
					Since acceleration of the block is zero, forces on the block are balanced. Since every force is along one or the other axis, it is very easy to write equations of motion along the two axes directly. Lets also just use <m> F_{s}^{\text{max}} = \mu_s F_N </m>. Also, lets use <m> F_{sp} = k \Delta l</m>. We need to find <m> \Delta l</m>.
					<md>
						<mrow> \amp F - \mu_s F_N - k\Delta l = 0,  </mrow>
						<mrow> \amp F_N - mg = 0,  </mrow>
					</md>
					Solve the second equation for <m> F_N </m> and use that in the first equation, which we solve for <m> \Delta l</m>.

					<me>
						\Delta l = \dfrac{1}{k} \left( F -\mu_smg \right).
					</me>
					Putting the numerical values in this equation we get
					<me>
						\Delta l  = \dfrac{1}{100} \left( 75 -0.2\times 30 \times 9.81 \right) = 0.161\text{ m}.

			<solution><title>a</title> 
				<p> 
					We start by identifying forces on the block in <xref ref="fig-bc-athlete-pulling-on-rope-forces"/>, where I have used symbols for the forces: <m> W </m> for weight, <m> T </m> for weight, <m> N_L </m> for the normal on the left foot, <m> N_R </m> for the normal on the right foot, <m> S_L </m> for the static friction on the left foot, and <m> S_R </m> for the static friction on the right foot.
				</p>

				<figure xml:id="fig-bc-athlete-pulling-on-rope-forces">

					</caption>
					<image source="./images/forces/bc-athlete-pulling-on-rope-forces.png" width="80%"/>
				</figure>
				<p>
					In the translational motion, we can combine the normal forces into one and call that <m> N=N_L+N_R</m>, and similary for the static friction, <m> S=S_L+S_R</m>. We will have to keep them separate when we look at rotation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since acceleration of the block is zero, the forces are balanced. Since only <m> T </m> is not along one of the axes, we will need to work out its components. Let <m> \theta </m> stand for angle <m> 15^{\circ}</m>.
					<me>
						T_x = T\,\cos\,\theta,\ \ T_y = T\,\sin\,\theta.
					</me>
					Now, we can write the equations of motion along the two axes.
	 			
					<md>
						<mrow> \amp  T\,\cos\,\theta - S = 0,  </mrow>
						<mrow>  \amp T\,\sin\,\theta + N - W = 0,  </mrow>
					</md>
					Here, the values of <m> T </m>, <m>\theta</m>, and <m> W=mg</m>, are known. Therefore, we solve the first equation to get <m> S </m>, and the second one for <m> N </m>.  

					<md>
						<mrow>   \amp S = T\,\cos\,\theta = 800 \times \cos\,15^{\circ} = 773\text{ N},  </mrow>
						<mrow>   \amp N = W - T\,\sin\,\theta  = 100\times 9.81 - 800 \times \sin\,15^{\circ} = 774\text{ N}.</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution><title>b</title>
				<p>
					The definition of <m> \mu_s </m> requires the maximum static friction.

					<me> 
						\mu_s = \dfrac{S^{\text{max}}}{N}.
					</me>
					From the problem description, we need the minimum <m> \mu_s </m>. That means, if we assume the <m> S </m> we found was the <m> S^{\text{max}}</m>, then the <m> \mu_s </m> we will get will be the minimum required for the static condition to hold.
					<me> 
						\mu_s^{\text{min}} = \dfrac{S^{\text{found}}}{N} = \dfrac{773}{774} = 1.0.

					<p>
						Let us use upward pointed <m>y</m> axis as in <xref ref="fig-one-pulley-two-blocks-on-one-pulley-solution"/>  to analyze the motion. Let <m>y_1</m>, <m>y_p</m>, <m>y_2</m> denote the positions of the centers of block 1, pulley <m>P_2</m>, and block 2 respectively. We will need <m>y_p</m> to figure out the relation between changes in <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m>.

				<p>
					Let us look at each string to find relations among changes in these <m>y</m>'s. To facilitate this, let <m>y_\text{top}</m> be the <m>y</m> of the fixed pulley. Let us also denote lengths of the strings by <m>l_1</m> and <m>l_2</m> respectively. Then, we have
					<md>
						<mrow> \amp \left( y_\text{top} - y_1 \right) + ( y_\text{top} - y_p ) = l_1 = \text{constant}</mrow>
						<mrow> \amp \left( y_p \right) + ( y_p - y_2 ) = l_2 = \text{constant}</mrow>

					Therefore, we have the following relations among the changes in the coordinates.

						<mrow> \amp \Delta y_1 + \Delta y_p  = 0</mrow>
						<mrow> \amp 2 \Delta y_p  - y_2   = 0</mrow>

						v_{2y} = -2v_{1y},\ \ a_{2y} = -2a_{1y}.
					</men>
					This relation between the accelerations and <m>y</m> equations of motion of the two blocks and the moving pulley (zero mass) will be sufficient to answer the questions about accelerations of the two blocks and the tensions. Using the force diagrams of each block we have the following equations.

					<md>

						<mrow> \amp T_2 - m_2 g = m_2 a_{2y}</mrow>
						<mrow> \amp T_1 - 2T_2 = 0</mrow>
					</md>
					Using Eq. <xref ref="eq-one-pulley-two-blocks-on-one-pulley-constraint"/>, we find

					<md>
						<mrow> \amp a_{1y} = \left( \frac{2m_2 - m_1}{m_1 + 4 m_2} \right)\; g,\ \ \  a_{2y} = -2a_{1y}. </mrow>
