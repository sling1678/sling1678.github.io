			We use the second law in the form <xref ref="eq-second-law-f-equal-ma" /> <m>(\vec F = m\vec a)</m> to define the property of mass operationally. We apply same force to two different objects and observe their resulting acceleration. The resulting accelerations will be
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp a_1 = \dfrac{F}{m_1}, </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp a_2 = \dfrac{F}{m_2}. </mrow>
			</md>

		</p>
		<p>
			We can divide out <m> F</m> to find that the ratio of their accelerations will be inversely proportional to their masses.
			<men xml:id="eq-a1-to-a1-eq-m2-to-m1">
			 \dfrac{a_1}{a_2} = \dfrac{m_2}{m_1}.
			</men>
		</p>

			Suppose we take a reference object and define its mass to be one unit of mass, say <m> 1 \text{ kg}</m>. Then, we perform the aforementioned experiment, i.e., apply an unknown but reproducible force on it. Suppose we find that the acceleration is <m> 4\text{ m/s}^2</m>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, we take an object whose mass we do not know yet. We subject this object to the same force and observe its acceleration. Suppose we find that its acceleration is <m> 6\text{ m/s}^2</m>. Then, Eq. <xref ref="eq-a1-to-a1-eq-m2-to-m1"/> can be used to deduce the mass of this other object.
			<me>
				\dfrac{m_2}{1\text{ kg}}  = \dfrac{4\text{ m/s}^2 }{6\text{ m/s}^2}\Longrightarrow m_2 = 0.5\text{ kg}.
			</me>

			The example above gives us a process by which, after we choose a reference object of unit mass, we can do experiments to assign mass to all other objects. We call this mass <term> inertial mass </term>.
