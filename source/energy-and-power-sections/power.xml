	<introduction>
		<p>
			The rate at which a force does work is called <term>power </term> of that force. That is, if work <m>W_{if}</m> is done over an interval of <m>\Delta t</m>, then,
			<men>
				\text{Power} = \text{Rate of Work} = \dfrac{W_{if}}{\Delta t}.
			</men>
		</p> 
		<p>
			Since work is proportional to the magnitude of force, more work will be done if you use a larger force for the same displacement. With a larger force, you will have to do more work but you would also get the work done in less time, and, consequently, will have more power. 
		</p> 
		<p>
			If force varies with time, then the rate of work will also vary with time. Therefore, we define two types of power - an <term>instantaneous power</term>, to be denoted by <m> P(t) </m> and an <term>average power</term> during an interval <m> t_i</m> to <m> t_f </m>, denoted by   <m> P_{\text{av}} </m>.

				Suppose a force <m> \vec F </m> acts on an object which is moving with instantanous velocity <m> \vec v </m> at instant <m> t </m>. In duration <m>t</m> to <m>t + \Delta t</m>, the displacment will be <m> \Delta \vec r = \vec v\Delta t</m>. Here we are thinking <m>\Delta t</m> to be small, ideally infinitesimal. Therefore, work during this interval is
				<me>
					W = \vec F \cdot \Delta \vec r = \vec F \cdot \vec v\Delta t.
				</me>

		</sidebyside>
		<p>
			We omit the subscriot <q><m>if</m></q> from <m>W</m> since the instants will be indistinguishable in the infinitesimal limit.  Dividing <m>W</m> by duration <m>\Delta t</m>, and ideally taking <m>\Delta t\rightarrow 0</m> limit in a Calculus sense, will give us the rate at which work is being done, i.e., the instantaneous power will be 
			<men xml:id="eq-instantaneous-power-dot-prod-def"> 
				P(t) =  \dfrac{W}{\Delta t} = \vec F \cdot \vec v.
			</men>
		</p>
		<p>
			As you know that the dot product can be written using magnitudes of <m> \vec F </m> and <m> \vec v </m> and angle <m> \theta</m> between them or in terms of their components, giving us other formulas for the instantaneous power.
			<men> 
				P(t) =  F\, v\, \cos\,\theta = F_xv_x + F_yv_y + F_zv_z.

	<subsection><title> Average Power</title>

	<idx>Average Power</idx>	
		<p>
			The average power is the average of this quantity over an interval. 
			<men>
				P_{\text{av}} = \text{Average of }P(t)\text{ over the interval }\Delta t.
			</men>
			If force and velocity are constant, then, averaging is easy to do. Say, both force and velocity are in the positive <m> x </m> direction with fixed magnitudes. Then, the average will be same as instantaneous. Then, by performing the following series of calculations, we can obtain an alternative form of average power, which is very useful in practice.
			<me>
				 P_{\text{av}} = F_x v_x = F_x\, \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{F_x\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \dfrac{W_{if}}{\Delta t}.
			</me>
			This demonstrates that the average power is the overall rate at which work is being perfomed by the force.
		</p>
		<p>
			<men  xml:id="eq-average-power-work-over-time-def">
				P_{\text{av}} = \dfrac{W_{if}}{\Delta t}.
			</men>
		</p>

		<p>
			Another way to average the instantaneous power, <m>P(t)</m>, is to plot <m>P(t)</m> versus time. The net area under the curve between <m>t_i</m> and <m>t_f</m> will give the net work done during the interval. Dividing that by the interval will give the average power.
		</p>
			<men>
				P_{\text{av}} = \dfrac{ \text{Area under }P(t)\text{ versus } t }{ \Delta t }.
			</men>
		<p>
			The SI unit of work and time gives us the unit of work as <m> \text{J/s}</m>, which is also called <term>Watts</term> and abbreviated by <m> \text{W}</m>. The unit <m>\text{Watts}</m> is named in honor of James Watts, who made critical improvements to early steam engines.

			<p> 
				We will use <m> P = \vec F\cdot \vec v</m>. The force is the weight of magnitude <m> mg </m>, down, in the same direction the velocity, therefore, the dot product will give:

					P(t) = mg v.

					P(t) = mg^2 t = 10\times 9.81^2\, t = 962.36\, t.
