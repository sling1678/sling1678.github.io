						<alert> Strategy. </alert> (1) When the block is sliding on the sphere, it has two forces - the weight and the normal force with centripetal acceleration based on the balance of the components of these forces in the direction towards the center of the sphere. The normal force will become zero at the point the block is not in contact with the sphere. We will set up an equation of motion for this point. (2) Due to the frictionless nature of the surface, we have energy conservation. The height dropped from the top will be <m> R - R \cos\,\theta</m>.

						\int_0^p p\, dp = \gamma\, m \int_0^t t dt.

					This gives <m>p^2 = \gamma m t^2</m>, where we will keep only positive root since motion is towards positive <m>x</m>-axis and <m>p</m> is <m>x</m>-component. Writing this as <m>x</m>-component as a reminder.

			<hint> <p>  Use conservation of momentum along horizontal direction and cnservation of energy for the combined system. Also, note horizontal CM of the combined system will not move. </p> </hint>
			<answer> <p> (B) and (C).  </p> </answer>
			<solution> 
				<p>
					First we notice that there will be no external force in the horizontal direction on the conbined system of mass and block together since the table is frictionless. That means <m>x</m>-momentum of the combined system will be conserved. In the problem, we are using symbol <m>v</m> for <m>v_x</m>, let us use <m>V</m> for <m>V_x</m> of the block with respect to the table. Therefore,
					<men xml:id="eq-momentum-conservation">
						m v + MV = 0.
					</men>
					Also, note that energy of the combined system will be conserved since there are no non-conservative forces. Thus, equating loss of potential energy of mass  <m>m</m> to the sum of kinetic energy gained, we get
					<men xml:id="eq-energy-conservation">
						\frac{1}{2}m v^2 + \frac{1}{2} MV^2 = m g R.
					</men>
					Using Eq. <xref ref="eq-momentum-conservation"/>, we get
					<me>
						m v^2 + M \left( m/M\right)^2 v^2 = 2 g R.
					</me>
					Solving this, we get
					<me>
						v = \pm \sqrt{ \frac{2gR}{ 1+ \frac{m}{M} } }.
					</me>
					This is <m>dx/dt</m>. We expect block to move towards positve <m>x</m>-axis and block to move towards negative <m>x</m>-axis. Therefore, this will be
					<me>
						v = + \sqrt{ \frac{2gR}{ 1+ \frac{m}{M} } }.
					</me>
					This is choice (B). With this choice for <m>v</m>, we can rule out choice (D) for the block since, using Eq. <xref ref="eq-momentum-conservation"/>, the block should have velocity
					<me>
						V = - \frac{m}{M}\,v = - \frac{m}{M}\,\sqrt{ \frac{2gR}{ 1+ \frac{m}{M} } }.
					</me>					
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, to work on position, we note that the <m>X_\text{cm}</m> of the combined system will not move during the motion of the mass <m>m</m>. <m>X_\text{cm}</m> at initial instant was at
					<me>
						X_\text{cm} = \frac{MX_0 + m x_0}{ M + m}, 
					</me> 
					where <m>x_0 = - R</m> and <m>X_0</m> was located at a distance <m>X_0</m> from the right edge of the block. These are shown in <xref ref="fig-jee-2017-q3-marble-on-block-solution-position"/>.
				</p>

					<figure xml:id="fig-jee-2017-q3-marble-on-block-solution-position">
						<caption></caption>
						<image source="./images/energy/jee-2017-q3-marble-on-block-solution-position.png" width="90%"/>
					</figure>				
				
				<p>
					When the mass has moved down to the exit point, the <m>x</m> coordinate of mass <m>m</m> is <m>x</m> and the <m>x</m> coordinate of the block is <m>x+X_0</m>.
					<me>
						X_\text{cm} = \frac{ M(x+X_0) + m x }{ M + m}, 
					</me>
					Equating these two expressions of 	<m>X_\text{cm}</m>  gives
					<me>
						MX_0 + m x_0 = M(x+X_0) + m x.
					</me>
					We solve this for <m>x</m> to get
					<me>
						x = \frac{mx_0}{M+m} = \frac{-m R }{M+m}.
					</me>
					This is how much block's <m>X_\text{cm}</m>  has also moved. Therefore, choice (C) is correct. This also rules out (A).
