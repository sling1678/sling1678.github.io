	<introduction>
		<p>
			In an earlier section, we found that coservative forces are special when it comes to work, viz., work by these forces are independent of the path between the initial and final positions. Such work can be written purely  in terms of initial and final positions, denoted by <m>U_i</m> and <m>U_f</m>, respectively.
			<me>
				W_{if}^{\text{conservative}} = U_i - U_f.
			</me>
			Now, we ask: <alert>what will happen if only conservative forces are acting on a body?</alert> Replacing work in the work energy theorem will give us guidance to the answer.
			<men xml:id="eq-work-energy-theorem">
				K_f - K_i = W_{if}^{\text{net}} = \sum W_{if}^{\text{conservative}} = \sum U_i - \sum U_f,
			</men>
			where <m>\sum U_i </m> is the sum of all potential energies, <m> U </m>, evaluated at instant <m> t_i </m>, and similarly for <m> \sum U_f </m>.
			<!-- But, <alert> if  all forces are conservative</alert>, then the left side can also be written in terms of potential energies of these forces. 
			<me>
				 \left( \sum U \right)_i  - \left( \sum U \right)_f   = K_f - K_i,
			</me>
			where <m>\left( \sum U \right)_i </m> is the sum of all <m> U </m> terms evaluated at instant <m> t_i </m>, and similarly for <m> \left( \sum U \right)_f </m>.  -->
			Rearranging terms in this equation we get
			<men xml:id="eq-kinetic-plus-potential-conserved">
				K_i +  \sum U_i   =  K_f +  \sum U_f.
			</men>
			That is, if <alert> all the forces  are conservative</alert>, then the combination <m> \left(K + \sum U \right) </m> is conserved during the motion. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We call the combination <m> K + \sum U  </m> <term>energy</term> (sometimes, mechanical energy), and denoted it by symbol <m> E</m>.
			<men xml:id="eq-definition-of-energy">
				E = K + \sum U. 
			</men>
			Equation <xref ref="eq-kinetic-plus-potential-conserved" /> can now be expressed rather compactly as follows. <alert>If all forces acting on the body are conservative forces, then energy cannot change</alert>. This is called the <term> principle of conservation of energy</term>.
			<men xml:id="eq-conservation-of-energy">
				E_i = E_f.\ \ \ \ (\text{all forces conservative})

		<statement>
			<p>
				A skier starts near the top of a hill. His speed at a point on the slope that is   <m> 50\text{ m}</m> above the sea level is <m> 5.0\text{ m/s} </m>.  
			</p>
			<p>
				What will be his speed when he reaches a point that is <m> 35\text{ m}</m> above the sea level, assuming you can neglect the effect of drag and kinetic fricion forces on the skier?
			</p>

		</statement>
		<!-- <hint> <p>  Energy is conserved. </p> </hint> -->
		<answer> <p> <m> 17.9\text{ m/s}.</m>  </p> </answer>
		<solution> 
			<p>
				Ignoring Drag and Kinetic Friction forces, the forces on the skier are (1) Weight and (2)  Normal. Normal force will do no work since, at each instant, it is perpendicular to the displacement. And weight is a conservative firce. Therefore, energy of the skier is conserved.
			</p>
			<p>
				Hence, by equating energy of the skier at the two instants in the problem statement we get
				<me>
					\dfrac{1}{2}mv_f^2 + mgy_f = \dfrac{1}{2}mv_i^2 + mgy_i.
				</me>
				The mass <m> m</m> cancels out. Solving for <m> v_f </m> we get
				<me>
					v_f = \sqrt{ v_i^2 + 2g(y_i - y_f) }.
				</me>
				Now, we put in the numbers.
				<me>
					v_f = \sqrt{ 5.0^2 + 2\times 9.81\times ( 50 - 35) } = 17.9\text{ m/s}.
				</me>					
			</p>
			<p>
				Note the requirement of no drag or friction was critical for us to use conservation of energy!

The other end of the spring is attached to a support while the block rests on a smooth horizontal table and can slide freely without any friction as illustrated in <xrfef ref="fig-energy-conservation-block-spring-horizontal"/>.

		<solution><title>b</title> 
			<p>
				
				When the block crosses the equilibrium point, <m> x = 0</m>. That means potential energy is zero at this point. Let <m> v_b</m> be the speed when passing through the equilibrium point (see <xref ref="fig-energy-conservation-block-spring-horizontal-b"/>).

		<solution><title> c </title> 
			<p>
				
				20 cm from the place the motion began, the block would be 8 cm from the equilibrium, because it will go 12 cm to equilibrium and then stretch another 8 cm. Let's call this <m>x_c</m> and the speed there as <m> v_c</m>. Therefore, the energy conservation will give

				<p>
					A satellite of mass <m> m </m> is to be placed in a circular orbit of radius <m> 2 R_E</m>, where <m> R_E</m> is the radius of the Earth. With what speed with respect to the fixed center of the Earth should the satellite be launched from a point on the equator of the Earth?

				<p></p>
			</sidebyside>
 			
		</statement>
		<hint> <p>  First find the speed when in the circular orbit by using Newton's equation for uniform circular motion. Then, find the energy when in the circular orbit. Finally, use energy conservation to find the speed of launch. </p> </hint>
		<answer> <p> <m> \sqrt{ \dfrac{3 G  M_E}{4 R_E } } \approx 6.8\text{ km/s}</m>.  </p> </answer>
		<solution> 
			<p>
				Strategy:  Let <m> v_0 </m> be the speed of launch and <m> v_c</m> the speed when the satellite is in the circular orbit. We will first obtain <m>v_c</m> from Newton's equation of motion for the circular motion. Then, we will get energy of the satellite when in the orbit. After that, energy conservation between energy when in circular orbit and immediately after lauch will give us a condition from which we will obtain <m> v_0</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The equation of motion of the circular orbit for uniform circular motion gives
				<me>
					m\,\dfrac{v_c^2}{ 2R_E } = G \dfrac{M_E m}{ \left(2 R_E \right)^2  }. 
				</me>
				Solve this for <m> \dfrac{1}{2}mv_c^2 </m> to get
				<me>
					\dfrac{1}{2} m v_c^2 = G \dfrac{M_E m}{ 4 R_E  }.
				</me>
				To this we add the potential energy to get the energy <m>E_c</m> when the satellite is in the circular orbit.
				<me>
					E_c = \dfrac{1}{2} m v_c^2 - G \dfrac{M_E m}{ 2 R_E  } = - G \dfrac{M_E m}{ 4 R_E  }.
				</me>
				The energy <m> E_0</m> at the instant after launch is
				<me>
					E_0 = \dfrac{1}{2} m v_0^2 - G \dfrac{M_E m}{ R_E  }.
				</me>
				Equating <m>E_0</m> and <m> E_c</m> we get
				<me>
					\dfrac{1}{2} m v_0^2 - G \dfrac{M_E m}{ R_E  } = - G \dfrac{M_E m}{ 4 R_E  }.
				</me>
				Therefore,
				<me>
					v_0 =  \sqrt{ \dfrac{3 G  M_E}{2 R_E } } \approx 6.8\text{ km/s}.
