	<introduction>
		<p>
			Work has a different meaning in physics than it has in everyday life.  In physics we say that a force has done work on an object if it has caused the object to move. We quantify the amount of work through a well-defined mathematical procedure to be described below. 
		</p>
		<!-- <p>
			Work is one way a transfer of energy occurs between two bodies. For instance, when a weightlifter lifts a barbell, he does work on the barbell, thereby raising the energy of the barbell. If you look into the body of the weightlifter you will find that energy in his body has decreased. Thus, a transfer of energy from weightlifter to barbell has occured.
			Similarly, when a tugboat pulls a ship, it does work on the ship and energy in the tugboat is transferred to the the ship.
		</p>
		<p>
			Energy transfer between two bodies also occurs due to the difference in temperature of the two bodies. This mechanism is called heat. We will study that in chapters in thermodynamics part. Till then, we will assume that energy transfer by heat in any of the examples is negligible compared to the ones as a result of work.
		</p>
 
		<p>
			Previously, when we studied Newton's second law of motion in the impulse-momentum form, we found that impulse was a cumulative effect of force over a period of time that informed us how much momentum would change due to a force. <alert> Work is similarly a cumulative influence of a force on the motion, but instead of accumulating over time, we accumulate the impact of the force over the path of the motion. </alert>
		</p> -->
		<p>
			The fundamental definition of work relies on Calculus, but work by a constant force can be defined without the need of Calculus. We will see both ways below. 
			<!-- In a later section, we will also derive a result called the work-energy theorem that quantifies the change in motion resulted by work. -->

				Suppose you pull on a suitcase with a constant force <m> \vec F </m> at all instants of an interval that begins at <m> t_i </m> and ends at <m>t_f</m>. During this time, the suitcase has a displacement  <m>  \vec r_{if} </m> as shown in <xref ref="fig-work-by-a-constant-force-on-suitcase" />. Other forces also may be acting on the suitcase, but here, we want work by this force alone.

			That is, work of a constant force will be

			Actually, a more succinct way of stating this is by way of dot product of vectors <m>\vec F</m> and <m>\vec r_{if}</m>. Thus, the following dot product gives <alert> work done by a constant force</alert> <m> \vec F</m>.

		<p> 
			From the product of force and displacment, we find that the unit of work will be <m> \text{N.m}</m>. Now, if we expand this into base units we find that work can be written in various equivalent units, including the unit of energy.
			<me>
				\text{N.m} = \frac{\text{kg.m}}{\text{s}^2}.\text{m} = \text{kg}.\left(\text{m}/\text{s} \right)^2 = \text{J}. 
			</me>
			That is <m>\text{N.m}</m> is same as unit of kinetic energy, i.e., Joule. Just because the unit of work is same as the unit of energy, <alert> work is not energy</alert>. We will show by work-energy theorem below that work is amount of energy that gets transfered between bodies that interact via a force between them.  When we study thermodynamics, we will encounter another mechanism by which energy is transferred between bodies - that mechanism will be called heat.

					Workers want to move a crate of mass <m>200</m> kg from a site on the ground floor to a third floor apartment.  They  know that they can either use the elevator first, then slide it on the third floor to the apartment or first slide the crate to another location marked C in the figure, take another elevator to the third floor, and then slide it on the third floor a shorter distance.

				The workers will need to apply a horizontal force equal in magnitude to the kinetic friction force. Since acceleration is assumed to be zero, the balancing of forces on the crate gives us the following for the magnitude of the kinetic friction force.

				That means the force by workers has this magnitude also. Let us denote this by <m> F</m>.
				<me>

				Since the force by the workers is in the same direction as the displacements, the work by them for a displacement <m>\Delta r </m> is

	<subsection><title>(Calculus) Fundamental Definition of Work </title>
	<idx><h>Work</h><h>Definition</h></idx>

		<p>
			To define work by any force, not just work by a constant force, we need to use Calculus. Once again, we want work by  a force <m> \vec F </m> during an interval <m> t_i </m>  to <m> t_f </m>. Suppose the body follows the path  shown in the <xref ref="fig-work-gen" />, under the influence of this force as well as other forces, not shown.
		</p> 



		<sidebyside widths="50% 5% 45%">
			<p>
				To define work by force <m> \vec F </m>  we first divide the full path into small straight segments. Then, we define the work on each segment by a dot product between the force vector and the displacement of that segment. For instance, we obtain the following work <m> \delta W </m>  on the segment <m> \Delta \vec r </m> in the figure. 

					<men xml:id="eq-work-general-segment">
						\delta W = \vec F\, \cdot\, \Delta \vec r,
					</men>
					which is obviously <m>F_{\parallel} |\Delta \vec r|</m>.

			<p></p>

		<!-- <p>

			Note that here the symbol <m> \delta </m> in <m> \delta W</m> refers to a small value we will obtain while <m> \Delta </m> in <m> \Delta \vec r </m> refers to the change in the position vector <m>\vec r </m>. 
		</p> -->
		<p>
			Summing <m> \delta W</m>'s over the entire path gives us the total work  <m> W_{if} </m> during the interval from <m> t_i </m>  to <m> t_f </m>. When the segments become infinitesimally small we write the sum as a  <term> line integral </term>, which we decorate with <m> \text{path} </m> to indicate that the value may depend on the path taken between positions <m> \vec r_i</m> and  <m> \vec r_f</m>.
				<men xml:id="eq-work-general-integral">
					W_{if} = \int_{\text{path}}\,  \vec F\, \cdot\, d\vec r.

This integral needs to be evaluated over the path given by the position vector <m> \vec r</m> at times in the interval <m>t_i </m> to <m> t_f</m>. These integrals require further processing before you can actually come to regular integral(s) that you would do to get the value. See the exercises below.

<!-- 		<p>

					<me>

					with
					<me>
					 	 m = \dfrac{3-2}{5-0} = 0.2,\ \ b = 2.
					</me>
					That is,
					<me>
					 	y = 0.2\, x + 2.
					</me>
					This can be used to eliminate <m> y </m> and <m> dy</m> from equations below.
				</p>
				<p>
					We use the unit vector for the direction from A to C to write the force vector in an analytic form. This unit vector is
					<me>
					 	\hat u = \dfrac{  (5-0)\hat i + (3-2)\hat j}{ \sqrt{(5-0)^2 + (3-2)^2}} = \dfrac{5}{\sqrt{26}}\, \hat i + \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{26}}\, \hat j.
					</me>
					Since kinetic friction is pointed in the opposite direction to the displacement, we get the following analytic expression for the force vector, since the magnitude <m> 10\, x\, y^2</m> is positive.
					<md>
					 	<mrow> \vec F \amp = -10\, x\, y^2\, \hat u</mrow>
					 	<mrow> \amp = -10\, x\, y^2 \left( \dfrac{5}{\sqrt{26}}\, \hat i + \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{26}}\, \hat j \right). </mrow>
					 </md>
					 The force and displacement vectors on this path are:
					 <md>
					 	<mrow> \amp d\vec r =  \hat i\, dx + \hat j\, dy = (\hat i\,  + 0.2\, \hat j)\, dx, </mrow>
					 	<mrow> \amp \vec F = -10\, x\, (0.2x + 2)^2 \left( \dfrac{5}{\sqrt{26}}\, \hat i + \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{26}}\, \hat j \right),</mrow>
					 </md>					 
					 where I used <m> dy = 0.2 dx </m> on this path so that we can write the work integral as an integral over <m> dx</m>.  
					 <me>
					 	W_{AC} = \int_{AC}\, \vec F\cdot d\vec r = \int_{0}^5\, \left( \text{ something here }\right) dx.
					 </me>
					 The dot product is ugly to work out. You can do that on a separate piece of paper. I found the following.
					 <me>
					 	W_{AC} = - \dfrac{52}{\sqrt{26}}\, \int_0^5\left(0.04\,x^3 + 0.8\, x^2 + 4\, x \right)dx  = -914\text{ N.m}.
					 </me>				 
				</p>
				<p> (c)
					Clearly, we get
					<me>
						\left| W_{AC} \right| \gt \left| W_{ABC} \right|.
					</me>
					This says that it would cost less energy to go on path A-B-C than to go directly.

				A hockey puck of mass <m>300\text{ grams}</m> is shot across a rough floor with the roughness different at different places, which can be described by a position-dependent coefficient of kinetic friction.
