    <title>Static Fluids</title>


    <introduction>
    	<p>
    		Liquid and gases are collectively called fluids.  Fluids differ from solids in their response to a force applied tangential to the surface, also called a shear force.  Fluids flow when a shear force is applied on them, but solids do not.
    	</p>
		<p>
  			In this chapter, we will study physical properties of static fluids, such as pressure, density and volume, and in the next chapter we will look at the dynamics of flow.
