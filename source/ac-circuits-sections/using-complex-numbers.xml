<section xml:id="Circuit-Analysis-Using-Complex-Numbers"><title>Circuit Analysis Using Complex Numbers</title>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			The equations resulting from the application of Faraday's loop rule to an AC circuit results in the summation of sine and cosine functions. These calculations using the trigonometric functions are usually messy and an alternative method is desirable.  It turns out that the algebra of complex numbers is better at these calculations than the sine and cosine functions.   
		</p>
		<p>
			The connection between complex analysis and sines and cosines comes from Euler's formula
			<men>
				e^{i\theta} = \cos\,\theta + i\,\sin\,\theta,
			</men>
			where <m>i = \sqrt{-1}</m>. Here, <m>\cos\,\theta</m> is the real part of <m>e^{i\theta}</m> and <m>\sin\,\theta</m> is the imaginary part of <m>e^{i\theta}</m>.
			<!-- The companion formula is
			<men>
				e^{-i\theta} = \cos\,\theta - i\,\sin\,\theta.
			</men>
			From these you can immediately see that you can express sines and cosines as exponetials.
			<mdn>
				<mrow> \amp \cos\,\theta = \dfrac{1}{2}\left( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta}\right),</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \sins\,\theta = \dfrac{1}{2i}\left( e^{i\theta} - e^{-i\theta}\right),</mrow>
			</mdn> -->
			Thus, in AC circuit calculations, we replace the cosine of the source voltage by a complex exponential. Then, we perform regular algebra. After completing the calculations, the real part of the final result corresponds to the answer we seek.
		</p>
		<p>
			To distinguish complex voltage representing a real voltage, we will use the same symbol, but place a tilde (&#x007e;) sign above the symbol, and similarly for currents. Thus, we will replace
			<me>
				V = V_0\,\cos(\omega t + \phi)
			</me>
			by
			<me>
				\tilde V = V_0\, e^{ i ( \omega t + \phi ) },
			</me>
			whose real part is the original real voltage. As a result, the complex voltage <m>\tilde{V}</m> across an element and complex current <m>\tilde{I}</m>  through it,  are related by a complex version of Ohm's law, we can call <term>Complex Ohm's Law</term>.
			<men>
				\tilde{V} = \tilde{Z} \tilde{I},
			</men>
			where the complex <q>resistance</q> denoted by <m>\tilde{Z}</m> is called the <term> impedance</term> or the <term> complex impedance</term> of the element. In the following we will work out expressions for  complex impedances of   resistor,  inductor and  capacitor. We will find that complex impedance of inductor and capacitor are imaginary with absolute values equal to their reactances.
		</p>
		<p>
			The inverse of the impedance is called <term>admittance</term> and is denoted by  <m>\tilde{Y}</m>.
			<me>
				\tilde{Y} =\frac{1}{\tilde{Z}}.
			</me>			

			We will see that the complex impedance allows one to treat resistors, capacitors and inductors in an AC circuit on an equal footing.

		</p>
	</introduction>
	<subsection><title>Rectangular and Polar Forms of Complex Numbers </title>
		<p>
			You may already know that a complex number has two parts and can be written using <m>i=\sqrt{-1}</m>. For instance, <m>3+i4</m> is a complex part whose real part is <m>3</m> and imaginary part <m>4</m>. This is called complex number written in rectangular or Cartesian form. You can imagine this as point <m>(3,4)</m> in a complex plane. You can think of complex plane as Cartesina <m>xy</m>-plane.
		</p>
		<p>
			Just as you can represent a point in <m>xy</m>-pane by <m>(x,y)</m> coordinates or corresponding polar coordinates <m>(r,\theta)</m>, you can do the same with a complex number. Thus, number <m>3+i4</m> will have polar representation <m>re^{i\theta}</m> with
			<me>
				r = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5,\ \ \theta=\tan^{-1}\left( 4/3\right) = 51^\circ.
			</me>
			We call <m>r</m> absolute value or amplitude of the complex number <m>x+iy</m> and <m>\theta</m> phase of the complex number. Suppose, we denote complex number <m>x+iy</m> by letter <m>z</m>. Then, we will often write its  <m>r</m> as 
			<m>
				r = |z|.
			</m>
			For instance,  absolute value of complex impedance is equal to the amplitude of the impedance we have defined above.
			<me>
				|Z| = |\tilde{Z}|.
			</me>
			Also, note that absolute value of a complex number with <m>r=1</m> will be 1. That is, if a complex number is purely exponential, i.e, if <m>z=e^{i\theta}</m>, then
			<me>
				|z| = \left| z=e^{i\theta} \right| = 1.
			</me>
			Yoou can immediately verify this by using Euler's formula given above and <m>\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta = 1</m>.		
		</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection><title>Complex Impedance of a Resistor </title>
		<p>
			Since current <m>I(t)</m> through a resistor and <m>V_R(t)</m>, the voltage drop across a resistor are in-phase, when we take their ratio to get impedance, the exponetials will cancel out, leaving just the real resistance <m>R</m>.
			<me>
				\tilde{Z}_R = \dfrac{\tilde{V}_R}{\tilde{I}} = R.
			</me>
		</p>
	</subsection>
	<subsection><title>Complex Impedance of an Inductor </title>
		<p>
			Since current <m>V_L(t)</m> across an inductor leads current <m>I(t)</m> through it by a phase of <m>\pi/2</m> radians, their ratio will give reactance times an exponential with a positive phase constant. 
			<me>
				\tilde{Z}_L = \dfrac{\tilde{V}_L}{\tilde{I}} = \omega L e^{i\pi/2} = i \omega L,
			</me>
			where I used <m>e^{i \pi/2} = \cos\, \pi/2 + i\, \sin\, \pi/2 = 0 + i = i</m>. Note that absolute value of this impedance is the expected reactance of the inductor.
			<me>
				|Z_L| = \omega L.
			</me>
			The phase of complex <m>Z_L</m> is <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
		</p>
	</subsection>

 	<subsection><title>Complex Impedance of a Capacitor </title>
		<p>
			Since current <m>V_L(t)</m> across a capacitor lags current <m>I(t)</m> through it by a phase of <m>\pi/2</m> radians, their ratio will give reactance times an exponential with a negative phase constant. 
			<me>
				\tilde{Z}_C = \dfrac{\tilde{V}_C}{\tilde{I}} = \dfrac{1}{\omega C} e^{-i\pi/2} = i \omega L,
			</me>
			where I used <m>e^{i \pi/2} = \cos\, \pi/2 - i\, \sin\, \pi/2 = 0 - i = - i</m>. Note that absolute value of this impedance is the expected reactance of the capacitor.
			<me>
				|Z_C| = \dfrac{1}{\omega C}.
			</me>
			The phase of complex <m>Z_C</m> is <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
		</p>
	</subsection>

	<subsection><title> AC Circuit Problems </title>
		<p>
			The first step in the analysis of an AC circuit is to replace circuit elements by their impedances.  Each resistor <m>R</m> is replaced by its <m>Z_R = R</m>, each inductance <m>L</m> is replaced by its impedance <m>Z_L = i\omega L</m>, and each capacitance is replaced by its impedance <m>Z_C =1/ i\omega C</m>.   Then, we subject the circuit by Kirchoff's current law for complexe currents and Faraday's loop rule for each loop in the circuit. We then, solve for complex currents and deduce the physical currents from the real parts of the complex currents. These steps are best illustrated by examples.
