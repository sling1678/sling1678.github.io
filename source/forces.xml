    <title>Newton's Laws of Motion</title>


    <introduction>

		<p>
			<idx>Dynamics</idx>
			So far we have addressed how to describe a motion. Now, we turn to forces that are the cause of motion. This subject is called dynamics and the description part is called kinematics. In this chapter we will study many commonly encountered forces and introduce you to Newton's laws of motion. You will learn how acceleration of a body is related to forces on the body. This chapter also provided many physical setting for practicising your problem-solving skills.
