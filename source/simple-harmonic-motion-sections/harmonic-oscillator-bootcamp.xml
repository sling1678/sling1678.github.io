		<problem><title> Bullet Hit and Embedded in Block Attached to a Spring   </title>
			<statement>
				<p>  
					A bullet of mass <m> m </m> and speed <m> v_0 </m> is fired horizontally on a block of mass <m> M </m> attached to a spring of spring constant <m> k </m> whose other end is fixed to a wall. The direction of the velocity of the bullet is along the length of the spring.  Upon impact, the bullet is embedded in the block.  
				</p>
				<image source="./images/simple-harmonic-motion/bc-bullet-hitting-block-attached-to-spring.png" width="80%"/>

				
				<p>
					(a) Ignoring damping, find the amplitude of the resulting harmonic motion.
				</p>
				<p>
					(b) Compare the energy of the bullet before impact to its energy when it momentarily comes to rest after the spring is compressed, i.e., at the turning point of the oscillatory motion. Is the energy of the bullet conserved? Why or why not?
				</p>

			</statement>
			<hint> <p>  (a) Use momentum conservation to find the velocity after impact, then use this to find the amplitude of oscillations, (b) Energy will not be conserved. </p> </hint>
			<answer> 
				<p> 
					(a)  <m> \frac{mv_0}{\sqrt{k(M+m)}}</m>, (b)  <m> E_i - E_f= \dfrac{M}{ m+M}\, E_i </m>.  
				</p> </answer>
			<solution> <title> (a) </title>
				<p>
					(a)
					Let <m>V</m> be the speed of the bullet+block together after the impact.  Momentum conservation across the impact gives
					<me>
						(m+M) V = mv_0.
					</me>
					Therefore, immediately after the impact they move at
					<me>
						V = \dfrac{m}{m+M}\, v_0.
					</me>
					The moving combo of block and bullet will compress the spring. Since spring force is a conservative force, we will use conservation of energy to figure out the amount of compression. Let <m> x </m> denote this quantity when maximally  compressed. At that point the masses momentarily come to rest.
					<me>
						\dfrac{1}{2}\,k x^2 = \dfrac{1}{2}\, (m+M)\, \left(\dfrac{m}{m+M}\, v_0 \right)^2.
					</me>
					Simplifying this we get
					<me>
						x = \dfrac{mv_0}{\sqrt{k(m+M)}}.
					</me>
					This is the amplitude of the subsequent oscillations.
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution> <title> (b) </title>
				<p>
					The energy of the bullet before impact is
					<me>
						E_{i} = \dfrac{1}{2}mv_0^2.
					</me>
					At the instant the combo of bullet and block momentarily comes to rest, the bullet has only potential energy
					<me>
						E_{f} = \dfrac{1}{2}kx^2 =  \dfrac{1}{2}\, \dfrac{m}{ m+M}\, m v_0^2.
					</me>
					Therefore, the loss in energy of the bullet is
					<md>
						<mrow> E_i - E_f \amp = \dfrac{1}{2}mv_0^2 \left( 1 - \dfrac{m}{ m+M} \right), </mrow>
						<mrow> \amp = \dfrac{M}{ m+M}\, E_i. </mrow>
					</md>
					Energy of the bullet is not conserved since, upon impact, work is done by the block on the bullet.

		<problem xml:id="pr-A-Block-Attached-to-Two-Springs-on-Opposite-Sides"><title> A Block Attached to Two Springs on Opposite Sides </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Two springs of spring constants <m> k_1 </m> and <m> k_2</m> are attached on the two opposite sides of a block of mass <m> m </m> and the free ends of the springs are attached to two fixed supports as shown in <xref ref="fig-bc-fig-Block-Attached-to-Two-Springs-on-Opposite-Sides"/>. The block rests on a frictionless flat horizontal surface and can move along the line of the two springs.  At equilibrium position of the block, the two springs are neither stretched nor compressed.
				</p>
				<p>
					 When the block is pulled a little, say a distance <m> A</m>, from the equilibrium position in the line of the springs and released from rest, the block executes a simple harmonic motion whose frequency depends on the spring constants of the two springs and the mass of the block.
				</p>

					<image source="./images/simple-harmonic-motion/bc-fig-Block-Attached-to-Two-Springs-on-Opposite-Sides.png" width="80%"/>
				</figure>

				<p>
					(a) By looking at forces on the block at an arbitrary point in time, find the equation of motion of the block.
				</p>
				<p>
					(b) From the equation of motion, show that the angular frequency of oscillation is given by <m> \omega=\sqrt{\omega_1^2+\omega_2^2}</m>, where <m> \omega_1^2 = k_1/m</m> and <m>\omega_2^2 = k_2/m</m>.
				</p>
				<p>
					(c) What is the kinetic energy of the block, when it returns to the equilibrium position after being let go from rest at <m> x = A</m>? 
				</p>

			</statement>
			<hint> <p>  (a) When setting up forces, be mindful of the direction of forces from the two springs. (b) Compare with the undamped simple harmonic oscillator. (c) Use energy conservation; both springs have potential energies initially. </p> </hint>
			<answer> <p>  (a) <m>m a_x = -\left( k_1 +k_2 \right)\,x</m>, (b) <m>\omega = \sqrt{\dfrac{k_1 +k_2}{m}} </m>, (c) <m> \dfrac{1}{2}k_\text{eff} A^2</m>, with <m>k_\text{eff}  = k_1 + k_2</m>.  </p> </answer>
			<solution><title> (a) </title> 
				<p>
					(a) <xref ref="fig-bc-fig-Block-Attached-to-Two-Springs-on-Opposite-Sides-solution"/> shows that forces from both springs are in the same direction. Therefore, the <m>x</m> component of the net force on the block is
					<me>
						F_x = -k_1\,x -k_2\,x = -\left( k_1 +k_2 \right)\,x.
					</me>

					<image source="./images/simple-harmonic-motion/bc-fig-Block-Attached-to-Two-Springs-on-Opposite-Sides-solution.png" width="80%"/>
				</figure>
				<p>
					Therefore, equation of motion will be
					<me>
						m a_x = -\left( k_1 +k_2 \right)\,x.
					</me>
					Dividing both sides by <m>m</m> we get
					<me>
						 a_x = -\dfrac{k_1 +k_2}{m}\,x.
					</me>			 
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution><title> (b) </title>
				<p>
					(b)
					Compring the equation of motion to the equation of motion of simple harmonic motion, <m>a_x=-\omega^2 x</m>, we see that the angular frequency of the block here is
					<me>
						\omega^2 = \dfrac{k_1 +k_2}{m},
					</me>
					which can be written as
					<me>
						\omega^2 = \omega_1^2 + \omega_2^2,

					with
					<me>
						\omega_1^2 = \dfrac{k_1}{m},\ \text{ and }\ \omega_2^2 = \dfrac{k_2}{m}.
					</me>				
				</p> 
			</solution>
			<solution><title> (c) </title>
				<p>
					From the conservation of energy, we note that kinetic energy at equilibrium will equal the potential energy at the end points of the motion.
					<me>
						KE = \dfrac{1}{2}k_\text{eff} A^2,
					</me>
					where <m>k_\text{eff} </m> will be

					(a)

	 				Eliminating <m>\Delta x_1</m> and <m>\Delta x_2</m> from the three equations above, we find
