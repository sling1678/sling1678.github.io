	<subsection><title>Energy of an Underdamped Oscillator </title>
		<p>
			Just as for any other system, the energy of a damped oscillator is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies. We will consider only the underdamped case, since, it is the only one that actually oscillates - the other two cases, the overdamped and the critically damped, do not oscillate.
			<men xml:id="eq-Energy-of-an-Underdamped-Oscillator-main">
				E = \dfrac{1}{2}m v^2 + \dfrac{1}{2}k x^2,
			</men>
			where <m> x </m> and <m> v</m> are for underdamped oscillator are
			<md>
				<mrow>
					\amp  x = A\,e^{-\gamma t/2}\, \cos( \omega^{\prime} t + \phi  ),	 
				</mrow>

				<mrow>
					\amp  v = -\dfrac{\gamma}{2}\, x - \omega^{\prime}\,A\,e^{-\gamma t/2}\, \sin( \omega^{\prime} t + \phi  ),	 
				</mrow>
			</md>
			When you insert these in Eq. <xref ref="eq-Energy-of-an-Underdamped-Oscillator-main" />, you get a really ugly expression, which shows that energy of the oscillator oscillates in time with decreasing amplitudes, but at twice the frequency of the oscillation of <m> x </m>.
			<!-- <md>
				<mrow> E = e^{-\gamma t}\,\amp \left[ \dfrac{1}{2}kA^2 +\right. </mrow>

				<mrow> \left. \amp \dfrac{m\gamma \omega^{\prime} }{4}\,A^2\sin( 2\omega^{\prime}t+2]\phi )
				 \right]</mrow>
			</md> -->
		</p>
		<p>
			But if you have a lightly damped oscillator, i.e., if <m> \gamma \lt\lt \omega </m>, meaning that the tendency to damp is considerably small compared to the tendency to oscillate, then, we can show that, <em> on average, energy dies out exponentially with time.</em>
			<men xml:id="eq-dissipation-of-energy-energy-t">
				E(t) \approx E(0)\, e^{-\gamma\, t},
			</men>
			where <m> E(0) </m> is the energy at initial time, which for a lightly damped oscillator is
			<me>
				E(0) \approx \dfrac{1}{2}k A^2.
			</me>
			Eq. <xref ref="eq-dissipation-of-energy-energy-t"/> shows that energy of a lightly damped oscillator reduces to about one-third in time, <m>\tau</m>, equal to inverse of <m>\gamma</m>.
			<me>
				\tau = \dfrac{1}{\gamma}.
			</me>
			This <m>\tau</m> is sometimes called <term>time constant</term> for energy decay. It gives us time for energy to decay to <m>1/e\approx 1/2.7</m> of the original energy.

	<subsection> <title> Quality Factor of Underdamped Oscillator </title>
		<p>
			Every physical system that oscillates, will have damping. That is, <alert> real oscillating systems are actually underdamped oscillators</alert>. Since, the amplitude of oscillations decreases with time, an important feature of a good oscillator will be to oscillate for many cycles before losing significant amount of energy. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<term> Quality factor</term> provides a standard way to talk about the goodness of an oscillator. We denote Quality factor by <m> Q</m>. A simple measure of Quality of an oscillator would be to divide the average energy in a particular cycle by the energy lost in the cycle, so that the less the energy is lost in a cycle, the more persistent are the oscillations, and therefore, higher the Quality.  
		</p>
		<p>
			For technical reasons, we define <m> Q </m> factor by dividing the energy at the beginning of a cycle to the energy lost in <m> \frac{1}{2\pi}</m> of a cycle rather than one cycle. The factor is not critical to the definition, since when we use <m>Q</m> factor, we are mostly interested in order of magnitude. But with <m> \frac{1}{2\pi}</m> of a cycle, we do get simple formula for <m>Q</m> when we apply this to a lightly damped oscillator as we will see below. Suppose <m>E(t)</m> be the energy at time <m>t</m>, then we would compute <m>Q</m> by
			<men>
				Q = \dfrac{E(t)}{\left| \Delta E\left(\text{during }t\text{ to }t+ \dfrac{1}{\omega^\prime}\right) \right| }.
			</men>		
			You could think of this definition as also telling us about amount of energy lost in <m>\frac{1}{2\pi}</m> of a cycle.
			<me>
				\left| \Delta E \text{ lost in next 1/2}\pi\text{ of a cycle} \right| = Q E.
			</me>
		</p>
	</subsection>

	<subsection> <title> Quality Factor of a Lightly Damped Oscillator </title>
		<p>
			The exact equations given above for <m> Q </m> of an underdamped oscillator are too complicated to be of much use, especilly since, most times, we use the concept of <m> Q </m> to characterize relatively good oscillators. These oscillators are called <term> light damped oscillators</term>. We identify an oscillator to be a lightly damped if the following condition holds.
			<men>
				\gamma \lt\lt \omega^\prime.
			</men>
			Under these conditions, energy on average decreases exponentially and is given by
			<men>
				E(t) = E(0) e^{-\gamma t}.
			</men>
			It is then easy to work out energy <m>\Delta E</m> lost during <m> t</m> to <m> t + \frac{1}{\omega} </m>, i.e., within <m>1/2\pi</m> of one cycle. Dividing <m>E(t)</m> by <m>\Delta E</m> and simplifying, we get quality factor to be:
			<men>
				Q = \frac{ E(0)e^{-\gamma t} }{ E(0)e^{-\gamma (t+1/\omega^\prime)} - E(0)e^{-\gamma t} } = \frac{1}{ e^{-\gamma/\omega^\prime} -1 } \approx \dfrac{\omega^\prime}{\gamma}
			</men>		
		</p>
		<p>
			Good oscillators such as tuning forks and guitar strings have <m> Q</m> values in the thousands.  Laser cavities have much higher <m> Q</m> values, exceeding <m>10^7</m>.  Of course, the undamped oscillator has zero  <m> \gamma</m>, and hence infinite <m>Q</m>.  <alert> There is no <m> Q</m> for the critically damped and overdamped cases since they do not oscillate</alert>. You might say, their <m> Q = 0</m>.
