		<p>
			Any frictional force will damp the motion, but viscous drag is a particularly easier damping force to work with analytically. 
			<men xml:id="eq-damped-oscillator-damping-force">
				\vec F_{visc} = -b\ \vec v\ \ \ (b \ge 0), 
			</men>
			where <m>b</m> is the proportionality constant that depends on the viscosity of the medium and the geometry of the moving object. We have a minus sign in  Eq. <xref ref="eq-damped-oscillator-damping-force"/> since drag opposes velocity.
		</p>
		<p>
			Viscous forces of this type act on objects moving in a fluid, such as air, water, oil, etc., if their speeds are not too great. A viscous damping can also be implemented by pushing and pulling a plunger into a gas cylinder as shown in  <xref ref="fig-sho-damping-mechanisms"/>(b). an arrangement called a dashpot.

	<subsection><title> Equation of Motion </title>
		<p>
			We place <m> x </m> along the spring with positive <m> x </m> axis in the direction in which spring stretches and origin at the position of the block when in equilibrium. With these choices, the <m> x</m> component of the net force from the two forces on the damped block will be
			<men>
				F_x = - k x - b v_x.
			</men>
			Therefore, equation of motion of a damped block is
			<men xml:id="eq-damped-oscillator-eq-of-motion">
				m a_x = - k x - b v_x.
			</men> 
			Solving this as a differential equation gives us all possible motions of a damped harmonic oscillator.

	<subsection><title> Three Types of Damped Oscillators </title>
		<p>
			Solutions of Eq.  <xref ref="eq-damped-oscillator-eq-of-motion" /> tell us about  <m> x </m> at an arbitrary instant <m> t</m>, possibly in terms of given <m>x_0</m> and <m> v_0 </m>, the position and velocity at initial instant <m> t=0</m>.  Once again, this can be done by treating Eq. <xref ref="eq-damped-oscillator-eq-of-motion" /> as differential equation. We will just borrow the solution found by advanced mathematics. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There are three types of solutions, depending upon the values of the parameters <m> m</m>, <m> k</m>, and <m> b</m>. Actually, only two effective parameters are needed. These are
			<mdn>
				<mrow> \amp \text{Free angular frequency, } \omega = \sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}},</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \text{Damping constant, } \gamma = \dfrac{b}{m}.</mrow>
			</mdn>
			Sometimes, formulas are written using another damping constant, <m> \beta </m>, instead of <m> \gamma</m>. For consistency of our treatment here, we will use <m> \gamma</m> in our formulas.
			<men>
				\beta = \dfrac{\gamma}{2} \equiv \dfrac{b}{2m}.
			</men>
			
		</p>

		<p>
			Depending on the relative values of <m> \omega </m> and <m> \gamma</m>, we get either an oscillating behavior or some other motion. The solutions tell us that there are three types of motion possible.
			<mdn>
				<mrow> \amp \text{Underdamped Oscillations: }\ \ \  \omega \gt \frac{\gamma}{2},</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \text{Overdamped Motion: }\ \ \  \omega \lt \frac{\gamma}{2},</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \text{Critically Damped Motion: }\ \ \  \omega = \frac{\gamma}{2}.</mrow>
			</mdn>

	</subsection>

	<subsection><title> Underdamped Oscillator Solution</title>
 
		<p>
			The underdamped solution can be written in many forms, but the following form is very useful in further understanding of what happens to the block as time passes.
			<men xml:id="eq-underdamped-oscillator-solution-A-exp-cos">
				x(t) = A\,e^{-\gamma t/2}\, \cos( \omega^{\prime} t + \phi  ),
			</men>
			where <m>\omega^{\prime} </m> is the oscilaltion angular frequency of the underdamped oscillator, given by
			<men>
				\omega^{\prime} = \sqrt{ \omega^2 - \gamma^2/4 },
			</men>
			which shows that the underdamped oscillator oscillates at another frequency than the <term> natural frequency</term>, <m> \omega</m>, which was the frequency at which the non-damped oscillator oscillated.
			The constants <m> A </m> and <m> \phi </m> are related to the initial <m>x_0</m> and <m> v_0 </m>. They are very complicated and not very illuminating. Here, I will just list the equations from which you can deduce <m>  A </m> and <m> \phi</m>.
			<mdn>
				<mrow> \amp A\cos\,\phi = x_0,</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp A\sin\,\phi = -\dfrac{v_0}{\omega^{\prime}} - \dfrac{\gamma}{2\omega^{\prime}}\,x_0. </mrow>
			</mdn>
			<xref ref="fig-underdamped-oscillator-x-vs-t" /> shows a plot of <m> x </m> versus <m> t</m> for an underdamped oscillator.	Clearly, an underdamped oscillator oscillates with decreasing amplitude.

The peaks and troughs of the cycles fall on exponential envelops, ash shown by dashed lines above and below, due to the exponential multiplicative factor <m> \exp(-\gamma t /2) </m> in the solution.

	<subsection><title> Overdamped Solution</title>
		<p>
			The overdamped solution shows only the exponential damping and no oscillations as illustrated in <xref ref="fig-overdamped-oscillator-x-vs-t"/>. The solution consists of two terms that decay at different rates.  
			<men xml:id="eq-overdamped-oscillator-solution-A-exp-B-exp">
				x(t) = A\,e^{-a\, t}  + B\,e^{-b\, t},
			</men>
			where, <m> a </m> and <m> b</m> are 
			<mdn>
				<mrow> \amp a = \dfrac{\gamma}{2} - \omega^{\prime\prime} , </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp b =  \dfrac{\gamma}{2} + \omega^{\prime\prime}, </mrow>
			</mdn>
			where
			<me>
				\omega^{\prime\prime} = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\gamma}{2} \right)^2 - \omega^2 }.
			</me>
			Since <m> \dfrac{\gamma}{2} \gt \omega \gt \omega^{\prime\prime} </m> for overdamping,  both <m> a </m> and <m> b</m> are positive numbers.

	<subsection><title> Critically Damped Solution</title>

		<p>
			The critically damped solution shows a combination of exponential damping and a linearly increasing solution that is also damped exponentially. That means there is no oscillation here either.
			<men xml:id="eq-criticallydamped-oscillator-solution-A-exp-B-exp">
				x(t) = A\,e^{-\gamma t / 2}  + B\, t\, e^{-\gamma t / 2}.
			</men>
			<xref ref="fig-damped-oscillators-x-vs-t"/> illustrates critically damped oscillator. Visually, critically damped and overdamped oscillators appear similar, but when you plot the overdamped and critically damped oscillators under same initial conditions,  as in  <xref ref="fig-damped-oscillators-x-vs-t"/>,  you would find that critically damped oscillator does a little better job of damping the motion.

				A very important application of critically damped oscillation is in car shock absorbers. A shock absorber provides critical damping to the springs of the suspension system and damps a car's motion smoothly and rapidly. Without a shock absorber, a car ride would be very bumpy and dangerous. The picture to the right is a rear shock absorber and spring of a BMW R75/5 motorcycle, where the shock absorber is in the inside space of the spring (Photo credits: uploaded by Jeff Dean for Wikicommons.)

				We have three formulas for <m>x</m> to choose from, depending upon the type of damping. The effective parameters are
