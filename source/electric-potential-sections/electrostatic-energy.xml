		<p>
			Work necessary to assemble a charge collection from charges at infinitely separated configuration is called <term>electrostatic energy</term> of the collection. Any collection of charges can be built by bringing one charge at a time at the final location as following examples illustrate.

			<alert>Assembling two charges <m>q_1</m> and <m>q_2</m> separated by a distance <m>r_{12}</m>. </alert>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			We first bring charge <m>q_1</m> from infinity and fix it at the origin. Since there was no charge before this charge, we would need no work to accomplish this since there is no force on the charge. 
			<me>
				W_1 = 0
			</me>
		</p>
		<sidebyside widths="60% 5% 35%">
			<p>
				Next, we bring <m>q_2</m> from infinity to a point that is a distance <m>r_{12}</m> from <m>q_1</m>. 
			</p>
			<p></p>

		</sidebyside>	
		<p>
			The work done by the agent for bringing this charge will equal the change in the potentialenergy of <m>q_2</m>. That is,
				<me>
					W_2 = q_2\,\phi_1 =  \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\, \dfrac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}}.
				</me>
			Adding <m>W_1</m> and <m>W_2</m>we get the net work of assembling the charge distribution. Thus, electrostatic energy of the two-charge system will be
			<me>
				U = W_1 + W_2 = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\, \dfrac{q_1 q_2}{r_{12}}.
			</me>

				We assemble this structure one charge at a time. We already know how much work it will cost to assemble the first two charges.

			Now, we hold <m>q_1</m> and <m>q_2</m> fixed it their final positions, and bring <m>q_3</m> fron infinity in the common field of both  <m>q_1</m> and <m>q_2</m>. The work will be equal to the change in potential energy of <m>q_3</m>, which will be
			<me>
				W_3 = q_3 \times \left( \phi_{13} + \phi_{23} \right),
			</me>
			where <m>\phi_{13}</m> is the potential of <m>q_1</m> at the final location of <m>q_3</m> and similarly for <m>\phi_{23}</m>. Therefore,

				W_3 =  \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\, \dfrac{q_1 q_3}{r_{13}} + \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\, \dfrac{q_2 q_3}{r_{23}}.

		<p>
			Equation <xref ref="eq-electrostatic-energy-N-charges"/> can be generaized for application to continuous charges. First we note that we can count each pair double and divide by 2 to get the same answer. We can treat the sum as two sums, one for <m>i</m> and the other for <m>j</m>. Factor out <m>q_i</m>, we find that the other sum is just potential of all other charges at the location of <m>i</m>.
			<md>

				<mrow> \amp = \dfrac{1}{2} \sum_{i} q_i\, \phi_{i}, </mrow>
			</md>
			where <m>\phi_i</m> is the potential of other charges at the location of charge <m>i</m>. 
			Treating this for continuous charges is simply replacing <m>q_i</m> by <m>\rho(x,y,z)dV</m>, <m>\phi_{\text{i}</m> by <m>\phi(x,y,z)</m>, and the sum by integral over entire space.

			<!-- If charges are only surface charges, we will integrate only over the surface. Let <m>\vec r</m> denote points on the surface, then we will do the following to get electrostatic energy.
			<men xml:id="eq-electrostatic-energy-continuous-charges-surface">
				U = \dfrac{1}{2}\iint  \sigma(\vec r)\, \phi(\vec r)\, dA.

			Similarly, for line charges, we will deal with some line charge density, <m>\lambda</m>.
