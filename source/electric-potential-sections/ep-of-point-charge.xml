	<section> <title>(Calculus) Derivation of the Formula for Electric Potential for Point Charge</title>
		<p>
			To derive formula in <xref ref="eq-electric-potential-point-charge-restate"/>  from the definition of electric potential given in <xref ref="Electric-Potential-Section"/>, we need to perform an integral from the reference point, which is at <m>r=\infty</m> to the field point P, which is at <m>r=r</m>. The integral is required to obtain work done because the electric force varies along the path. Setting the test charge <m>Q</m> to unity makes the integral equal to the electric potential at P.
			<men>
				\phi_P = - \int_\text{ref}^{P} \vec E \cdot d\vec r.
			</men>
			Since electric field is radial, the dot product with <m>d\vec r</m> gives
			<me>
				\vec E \cdot d\vec r = E\: dr = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\frac{q}{r^2}dr,
			</me>
			where I have replaced
			the magitude of electric field <m>E</m> by its formula obtained in previous chapter. 
			With reference at <m>r=\infty</m>, upon doing the integration we get the desired result.
			<md>
				<mrow>\phi_P \amp = - \int_\text{\infty}^{r}\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\frac{q}{r^2}dr </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\frac{q}{r}.</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>


		<!-- <p>
			Consider a positive charge <m>+q</m> at the origin. We know that it will have electric field in the space around the charge. At a point a distance <m>r</m> away for the charge, electric field has the following magnitude in every direction from the charge.
			<me>
				E = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\dfrac{q}{r^2}.
			</me>
			 
		</p>
		<sidebyside widths="55% 5% 40%">
			<p>
				To find this formula based on the definition of electric potential given in <xref ref="Electric-Potential-Section"/>, we need to perform an integral from the reference point to the point P, but the result is easy to state and use. Consider two points <m>P_1</m> and <m>P_2</m> that are at distances <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m> from <m>q</m>. 
			</p>
			<p> </p>
			<image source="./images/electric-potential/potential-point-charge-two-space-points.png" width="60%"/>
		</sidebyside>
		
		<p>
			Then, we will show below that the difference in potential at these two points is given by
			<men xml:id="eq-difference-in-potential-point-charge">
				\phi_2 - \phi_1 = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\dfrac{q}{r_2} - \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\dfrac{q}{r_1}.
			</men>
			Say, point <m>P_1</m> is reference, then, we will get the potential at point <m>P_2</m> as
			<me>
				\phi_2 = \phi_\text{ref} + \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\dfrac{q}{r_2} - \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\dfrac{q}{r_\text{ref}}.
			</me>
			Choosing <m>r_\text{ref} = \infty</m>, placing the reference point far far away from <m>q</m> will remove the last term, and choosing <m>\phi_\text{ref}=0</m> further simplifies the formula.  Therefore, we make the following choices
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp r_\text{ref} = \infty,</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \phi_\text{ref} = 0. </mrow>
			</md>
			Then, potential at <m>P_2</m> will be a simple formula.
			<me>
				\phi_2 =   \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\dfrac{q}{r_2}.
			</me>
			Since point <m>P_2</m> is an arbitray point, we do not need to continue with the subscript <m>2</m>, and write formula for potential at point that is located a distance away from a point charge <m>q</m> for reference here.
			<men xml:id="eq-electric-potential-point-charge">
				\phi = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\,\dfrac{q}{r}.\ \ (r_\text{ref}=\infty)
			</men>		
			The choice <m> r_\text{ref} = \infty</m> may not be possible in some situations. For instance, we will see that if the source of potential is a line of charges, we need the reference point to be located at some finite distance from the wire.

	<!-- <subsection> <title> (Calculus) Derivation of Potential Difference Due to a Point Charge</title>
		<p>
			We want to show how Eq. <xref ref="eq-difference-in-potential-point-charge"/> follows from the definition of potential difference in terms of work done on a test charge. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Suppose you move a test charge <m>Q</m> in the presence of the fixed source charge <m>q</m> with the condition that you balance the electric force <m>\vec F_e</m> on <m>Q</m> by your force, <m>\vec F</m>. We wish to find the work done by <m>\vec F</m>, which is
			<me>
				\vec F = -\vec F_e = -\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\, \dfrac{qQ}{r^2}\hat u_r, 
			</me>
		</p>
		<figure>
			<caption>
				Figure to aid on caluclation of work on test charge <m>Q</m> when we move it from <m>P_1</m> to <m>P_2</m> from force <m>\vec F</m> that balances the electric force. Since electric force is a conservative force, the work integral is independen of the path. Figure shows vectors for the case of both charges positive.
			</caption>
			<image source="./images/electric-potential/potential-energy-change-point-charge.png" width="60%"/>
			
		</figure>
		<p>
			where <m> \hat u_r</m> is a unit vector from <m>q</m> to <m>Q</m>.
			Work done by this force for a displacement <m>\vec r</m> to <m>\vec r + d\vec r</m> will be
			<me>
				dW = \vec F\cdot d\vec r = - \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\, \dfrac{qQ}{r^2}\, dr,
			</me>
			where <m>r</m> is the spherical radial coordinate. Integrating this from position <m>r=r_1</m> to <m>r=r_2</m> we get
			<md>
				<mrow> W_{1\rightarrow 2} \amp = -\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \int_{r_1}^{r_2}\, \dfrac{qQ}{r^2}\, dr. 
				</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\, \dfrac{qQ}{r_2} - \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\, \dfrac{qQ}{r_1}.</mrow>
			</md>
			Dividing this by test charge <m>Q</m> gives the difference in electric potential between the two points.
			<me>
				\phi_2 - \phi_1 = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\, \dfrac{q}{r_2} - \dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\, \dfrac{q}{r_1}.
