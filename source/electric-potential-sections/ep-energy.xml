			Consider an electric charge <m>q</m> fixed at some place and move another charge <m>Q</m> towards <m>q</m> in such a manner that at each instant the applied force <m>\vec F</m> exactly balances the electric force <m>\vec F_e</m> on <m>Q</m> as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:e-potential-energy-1}. Work done  by the applied force <m>\vec F</m> on the charge <m>Q</m> changes potential energy of <m>Q</m>. We call this potential energy, more specifically, electrical potential energy, of <m>Q</m>.

			Suppose charge <m>Q</m> is moved from point <m>P_1</m> to another point <m>P_2</m>. How much would the potential energy of <m>Q</m> change?  To find this we can work out the work done <m>W_{12}</m> by the applied force <m>\vec F</m> when the particle moves from <m>P_1</m> to <m>P_2</m>.  This requires the evaluation of the following work integral along the path of movement of the charge <m>Q</m>.

			Consider a region of space in which electric field is not zero. Let <m>\vec E</m> denote the electric field. When we move a charge <m>Q</m> in this space, it will experience an electric force, <m>\vec F_e</m>.
			<men xml:id="eq-electric-force-from-electric-field">
				\vec F_e = Q\vec E.
			</men>
			<!-- Suppose, now if you move <m>Q</m> from point <m>P_1</m> to another point <m>P_2</m>, without the charge accelerating, you would need another force <m>\vec F</m> to balance the electric force <m>\vec F_e</m> as you move <m>Q</m>. 
			<me>
				\vec F = -\vec F_e = - Q\vec E.
			</me>
			Work done <m>W_{12}</m> by  <m>\vec F</m> equals the change in potential energy of <m>Q</m> due to electric force. We also call this change in electrical potential energy. We will denote the change in electrical potential energy by <m> U_2 - U_1</m>.
	 
			<md>
				<mrow> U_2 - U_1 \amp = W_{12}, </mrow>
				<mrow>  \amp = \int_{P_1}^{P_2}\, \vec F \cdot d\vec r, </mrow>
				 <mrow> \amp = Q \left( - \int_{P_1}^{P_2}\, \vec E \cdot d\vec r \right).</mrow>
			</md> -->
			This force is a consersvative force. Hence, work done by this force can be used to define potential energy of charge <m>Q</m>. By convention, we say that each charge has electrical potential energy (<m>\text{EPE}</m>) based on its position. If we move charge <m>Q</m> from point <m>P_1</m>, say with position vector <m>\vec r_1</m>, to another point <m>P_2</m> with position vector <m>\vec r_2</m>. Then, the change in <m>\text{EPE}</m> will be
			<me>
				\text{EPE}_2 - \text{EPE}_1 = - W_{12},
			</me>
			where <m>W_{12}</m> is work done by the electric force in Eq. <xref ref="eq-electric-force-from-electric-field"/>. Based on expression for <m>\vec F_e</m>, it is immediately clear that <m>W_{12}</m> will be proportional to <m>Q</m>. Therefore, we can divide out <m>Q</m> and obtain a quantity that does not depend on <m>Q</m>.
			<me>
				\dfrac{ W_{12} }{Q} \text{ independent of }Q.
			</me>
			When you strip away <m>Q</m> from <m>W_{12}</m>, you are left with only the electrical effect of other charges in the region of space in which you moved <m>Q</m>. We give that influence in the region electric potential. We will denote this by letter <m>U</m>. Thus, we write the change in potential between space points <m>P_1</m> and <m>P_2</m> by 
			<me>
				U_2 - U_1 = -\dfrac{ W_{12} }{Q}.
			</me>			
			Just as we can select a reference zero place for potential energy, We can choose a reference point, say <m>P_\text{ref}</m>, where we can set <m>U_\text{ref} = 0</m>. Now, suppose we move <m>Q</m> from the reference point to arbitrary point <m>P</m>, then we will get electric potential  <m>U_P</m> at  <m>P</m>.
			<men>
				U_P = -\dfrac{ W_{\text{ref}\rightarrow2} }{Q}.
			</men>
			Electric potential <m>U_P</m> will depend on the coordinate of point <m>P</m> and the charge or charges whose potential we detect by using the test charge <m>Q</m>. It is important to note that <m>U_P</m> does not tell us anything about <m>Q</m> since it cancels out.
