        <p>
        	A <term>pinhole camera</term> is an optical device that projects inverted image of an object on a screen without using any lens or mirror.  It can be easily made from a cardboard box and a wax paper.  Replace one side of the cardboard box by a wax paper to serve as the screen.  Make a small hole in the middle of the opposite side.

        <p>
        	Rays of light from an object pass the hole and meet on the screen and make an inverted image as shown in <xref ref="fig-pinhole-camera"/>.

			A detector such as a photographic plate may be placed in place of the wax paper at the back side to record the image.  Pin-hole camera is useful for viewing a solar eclipse where you can look at the image of the sun instead of looking at the sun directly.

    <subsection><title>F/# of a Pinhole Camera</title>
        <p>
            Let <m>D</m> be the diameter of the room and <m>L</m> the distance from the hole to the back wall of the room where image is projected. This <m>L</m> serves as the replacement of the focal length <m>f</m> in case of a lens. Therefore, F/# of the pinhole can be written as
            <me>
                F/\# = \frac{L}{D}.
            </me>
