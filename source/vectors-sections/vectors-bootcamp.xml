				<p>
					Let <m>\vec R</m> be the bodydiagonal vector. This will be
					<me>
						\vec R = a\,\hat u_x + a\,\hat u_y + a\,\hat u_z.

					Now, we divide i=by its magnitude to get a unit vector in this direction. Let us denote it by <m>\hat u_R</m>.
					<me>
						\hat u_R = \frac{a\,\hat u_x + a\,\hat u_y + a\,\hat u_z}{\sqrt{a^2 + a^2 + a^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left( \hat u_x + \hat u_y + \hat u_z\right).

					A unit vector in the direction of <m>\vec N</m> will simply be equal to the vector <m>\vec N</m> divided by the magnitude of this vector.

					Putting <m>\vec R = a \hat u_x + a \hat u_y + a \hat u_z</m> in Eq. <xref ref="eqn-vectors-prob-cube-body-diagonal"/> gives the following equation for the components of the normal we seek.

					There are infinitely many answer to the given problem since any vector in the plane perpendicular to the body diagonal will be perpendicular to the vector along the body diagonal.

				<p>
					We will not do the full blown proof.  We will assume that the area of the base times height equals the volume.

				<p>
					We will now show that <m>\vec A\cdot ( \vec B \times \vec C)</m> is equal to the area of the base times height.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's start with noting that the magnitude of the cross-product <m>\vec B \times \vec C</m> is equal to the area of the base whose edges are the vectors <m>\vec B</m> and <m>\vec C</m> and the direction of this product is normal to the area.

Now, the dot product between <m>\vec A</m> and <m>\hat u_n</m> will equal the magnitude of the projection of vector <m>\vec A</m> on the normal direction, which is equal to the height.
				</p>
				<p>
					Therefore,  <m>\vec A\cdot ( \vec B \times \vec C)</m> would be equal to the product of the area of the base and the height, which is equal to the volume.

			<solution><title>a</title>
				<p> 
					
					Let's use simpler notation in our calculations. 
					Let <m> v </m> denote the speed of the river with respect to the shore.  Let <m>u</m> be the speed of the boat with respect to the shore. Let <m>x</m> axis be in the direction of the river flow and <m>y</m> axis directly across. Then, Eq. <xref ref="eq-crossing-river" />, written using components form of the vectors is (suppressing the units):
					<me>
						(0, u) = (-5\sin 30^{\circ}, 5\cos 30^{\circ}) +  (v, 0).
					</me>
					This gives us two equations, one along the <m> x </m> axis and the other along the <m> y </m> axis. 
					<md>
						<mrow> 0 = -5\sin 30^{\circ} + v </mrow>
						<mrow> u = 5\cos 30^{\circ} + 0</mrow>

					This gives <m> u = 4.33\text{ m/s} </m> and <m> v = 2.5 \text{ m/s}</m>. We will use <m> u </m> in part (b). The river is flowing at speed <m> v = 2.5\text{ m/s} </m>.

					The boat moves at speed <m> u = 4.33 </m> m/s across the river which is <m> d = 100\text{ m} </m>. Therefore, it will take
