			Vectors are not like simple numbers. They have magnitude, which is a simple positive number, but they also have a direction, which is not a number but a description. Addition of vectors requires special procedure and much care.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are basically two ways to add vectors - (1) graphically, and (2) analytically. The graphical addition procedure is more visual and important for understanding how vectors act together to produce a net vector. The analytical procedure is algebraic and hides much of the intuition, but it is also much easier to implement, especially when multiple vectors have to be added.

			We have already done this in the section on using arrows with a scale for the length-to-magnitude relation to represent vectors. The main idea is in the parallelogram law of addition of vectors. You can review that section and then come back here to get other ways of adding vectors.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the sake of review, let us use our intuition by looking at adding two force vectors. Suppose two of your friends push on you at right angles to each other. You know that the net effect will be at an angle between them. Another thing that you might not notice in this simple experiment is that the net force on you will be less than the sum of the two forces. For instance, one friend pushed on you with <m>10\text{ N}</m> and the other friend with <m>15\text{ N}</m>, then net force on you will NOT BE <m>25\text{ N}</m> if they are pushing at right angle to each other.

				It has been known for a long time that forces add such that if you draw forces on the two sides of a parallelogram, their sum will have magnitude and direction of one of the diagnals of the parallelogram. Which diagonal? Well, if you draw both force coming out of a common vertex with the same scale as in <xref ref="fig-adding_force_vectors_parallelogram"/>, then, net force will be along the diagonal with that same vertex. This is called <term>parallelogram law of addition</term>. Not only forces, but all vectors add this way.

		<p>
			An alternative view of vector addition by a diagram is shown in  <xref ref="fig-vector-sum" />(b) with position vectors <m>\vec r_1</m> and <m>\vec r_2</m>. Here, we move the second vector so that it starts at the tip of the first vector. Then, the vector from the tail of the first vector to the tip of the second vector would be the same as the diagonal of the corresponding parallelogram, and hence would be the sum of the two vectors. This method is often called <term> tip-to-tail method of addition</term>.

		    <!-- You can add vectors diagramatically or analytically. I will show first how to do it analytically using the coordinate-form of the vectors. --> 
		    The diagramatic addition of vectors illustrated above is very visual and is good for building intuitions and for appreciating the fact that VECTORS DO NOT ADD LIKE REGULAR NUMBERS. There is an alternative approach based on first converting given vectors into sum of vectors along Cartesian axes (or any orthogonal set of axes, for that matter). This method is called the Analytic Method.
		</p>
		<p>
		    Suppose you have two position vectors <m> \vec r_1 </m> and <m> \vec r_2 </m> and you want their sum <m> \vec r_{\text{sum}} </m> as shown in <xref ref="fig-sum_of_vectors_analytically"/>. Formally, we write the parallelogram addition of  vectors <m> \vec r_1 </m> and <m> \vec r_2 </m> as a vector equation.
			<men xml:id="eq-vector-sum"> 
				\vec r_{\text{sum}} = \vec r_1 + \vec r_2.
			</men>
			<alert>Beware: </alert> THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE LENGTH OF THE SUM VECTOR IS EQUAL TO THE SUM OF THE LENGTHS OF THE TWO VECTORS BEING SUMMED!!!.
			<me>
				\text{length of }\vec r_{\text{sum}} \ne (\text{length of }\vec r_{1}) + (\text{length of }\vec r_{2}).
			</me> 
			Replacing Eq. <xref ref="eq-vector-sum"/>  by coordinate representations of the three vectors, we might write it like the following.
			<me>
				x_{\text{sum}}\,\hat u_x +  y_{\text{sum}}\,\hat u_x = x_1\,\hat u_x +  y_1\,\hat u_x + x_2\,\hat u_x +  y_2\,\hat u_x.
			</me>

			Or, in a more compact notation, in which we suppress writing the unit vectors explicitly.
			<me> 
				\left( x_{\text{sum}}, y_{\text{sum}}\right) =  (x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2).
			</me>
			<!-- If vectors were in three-dimensional space, we will also have their <m>z</m>-components. -->

				<!-- You will learn below that you can sum two vectors by placing one vector at the tip of the other vector and the sum will be from the tail of the first to the tip of the second. --> 
				If you look at the diagram in (b), you will immediately see that <m>x_\text{sum}</m> is just sum of <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m>, and similarly for the <m>y</m> parts.
				<mdn>

		<!-- </sidebyside> -->

		<p>
			Now, <alert> if we wanted the magnitude and direction of the sum vector, </alert> we  can just use the <m> (x,y) </m> to <m> (r, \theta)</m> transformations, as we do for any vector.
			<mdn> 
				<mrow>  \amp r_{\text{sum}} =  \sqrt{ x_{\text{sum}}^2 + y_{\text{sum}}^2 }</mrow>
				<mrow>  \amp \tan \theta_{\text{sum}} =  \dfrac{ y_{\text{sum}} }{ x_{\text{sum}} } </mrow>
			</mdn>
			Once we get the angle, we deduce the direction from the angle value based on the quadrant the vector is pointed, and then we state the direction as clockwise or counterclockwise angles from Cartesian axes.

 				Here we can choose to describe the direction by the angle a vector makes with the positive <m>y</m> axis in a counterclockwise sense as we look at the <m>yz</m> plane from positive <m>x</m> axis direction.

 			<p>
 				The sum of these vectors, to be denoted by <m>\vec F</m> will have the following components.
				<md>
					<mrow>\amp 
						F_{x} =  (50-100)\ \textrm{N} = -50\ \textrm{N}

				</md>
				From these components we construct the magnitude of the net vectors to be
				<me>
				F = \sqrt{F_x^2 +F_y^2} = \sqrt{(-50\ \textrm{N})^2 + (86.6\ \textrm{N})^2 } = 100\ \textrm{N}.
				</me>
				The direction of this vector can be given by the angle with respect to the positive <m>x</m> axis.  Since the <m>x</m>-component is negative and the <m>y</m>-component is positive, the vector will fall in the second quadrant. To obtain the counterclockwise angle from the arctangent of ratio of y to x we will need to add <m>180^{\circ}</m> to the answer.
				<me>
				\theta = 180^{\circ} + \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{-50}{86.6}\right) = 180^{\circ} - 30^{\circ}  = 150^{\circ}.
