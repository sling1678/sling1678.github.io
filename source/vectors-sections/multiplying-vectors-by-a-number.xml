	<introduction>
		<p> 
			We have already talked about multiplying a vector by a regular number. For instance, if we multiply a vector <m> \vec A = (\text{magnitude } = 10 \text{ cm}, \text{ direction to East}) </m> by <m> 5 </m>, we will get another vector <m>\vec B</m>  that is <m> 5 </m> times as long and in the same direction as <m> \vec A</m>. We can write the resulting vector as <m> 5 \vec A</m>. 
			<me> \vec B = 5 \vec A </me>
			On the other hand, if we multiply by <m> -5 </m>, we will get a vector <m> \vec C </m>, which is also <m> 5 </m> times as long, but its direction will be opposite that of <m> \vec A </m>.
			<me> \vec C = -5 \vec A  = -\vec B</me>
		</p>

			In the next sections, we will talk about multiplying two arbitrary vectors <m> \vec A </m> and <m> \vec B</m>.  There are <alert> two different types of multiplication </alert> between two vectors, one results in a number and the other results in another vector.
