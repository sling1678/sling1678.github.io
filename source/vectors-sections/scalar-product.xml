		We have already discussed the definition of scalar products in <xref ref="subsubsection-Graphical-Scalar-Or-Dot-Product"/>. To recap, the value of scalar product between two vectors <m>\vec A</m> and <m>\vec B</m> is ordinary multiplication of the magnitude of one of the vectors and the projection of the other vector on this vector.

			Mathematically, we we able to write this using the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.
			<mdn>
				<mrow >
					\vec A \cdot \vec B \amp= A_{\parallel B} B
				</mrow>
				<mrow xml:id="eq-dot-product-from-mag-and-angle-recalled">\amp  = A B_{\parallel A} = A B \cos\theta.</mrow>

	<p>
		Here, <m>A_{\parallel B}</m> is prjection of vector <m>\vec A</m> on vector <m>\vec B</m> and <m>B_{\parallel A}</m> is prjection of vector <m>\vec B</m> on vector <m>\vec A</m>. These are explained in <xref ref="subsection-Projection-of-one-Vector-Over-Another"/>.
	</p>
	<p>

		Here, we will learn to make use of the Cartesian components of these vectors. Let us write each vector in terms of its Cartesian components.
		<md>
			<mrow> \amp \vec A = A_x \hat u_x + A_y\hat u_y + A_z \hat u_z</mrow>
			<mrow> \amp \vec B= B_x \hat u_x + B_y\hat u_y + B_z \hat u_z</mrow>
		</md>
		We can make us of the Distributive Property <xref ref="Scalar-Product-Distributive-Property"/> of scalar product to expand their product as follows.
		<md>
			<mrow>\vec A \cdot \vec B \amp = \left(A_x \hat u_x + A_y\hat u_y + A_z \hat u_z\right) \cdot \left( B_x \hat u_x + B_y\hat u_y + B_z \hat u_z\right>)</mrow>
			<mrow> \amp = A_xB_x \hat u_x\cdot \hat u_x + A_x B_y \hat u_x\cdot\hat u_y+\cdots</mrow>
		</md>
		Now, the dot product between the unit vectors along the axes is easily worked by using the angle form of the product in Eq. <xref ref="eq-dot-product-from-mag-and-angle-recalled"/> giving simple results.
		<md>
			<mrow>\amp \hat u_x \cdot \hat u_x = |\hat u_x||\hat u_x|\cos\,0^\circ = 1 \times 1 \times 1 = 1. </mrow>
			<mrow>\amp \hat u_x \cdot \hat u_y = |\hat u_x||\hat u_y|\cos\,90^\circ = 1 \times 1 \times 0 = 0. </mrow>
		</md>
		You can work out the other pairs you need. The upshot is that the product between Cartesian components equals <m>1</m> when they are the same vectors and zero otherwise.
		<men>
			\hat u_i \cdot \hat u_j = 
			\begin{cases} 
				1 \amp\quad \text{ if } i = j,\\
				0 \amp\quad \text{ if } i \ne j,\\
			\end{cases}
		</men>
		where <m>i</m> and <m>j</m> stand for <m>x,y,z</m>. Now, we can complete the calculation for the dot product in terms of components left with <m>\cdots</m> above.
		<men xml:id="eq-dot-product-from-components-derived">
			\vec A \cdot \vec B = A_xB_x \hat u_x\cdot \hat u_x + A_x B_y \hat u_x\cdot\hat u_y+\cdots = A_xB_x + A_yB_y + A_zB_z.

		Scalar or dot product of two vectors results in a single real number. To be specific, consider two vectors <m>\vec A</m> and <m>\vec B</m> that have an angle <m>\theta</m> between them as shown in <xref ref="fig-vector-dot-product"/>. We denote the scalar product by placing a dot between the abstract symbols <m> \vec A </m> and <m> \vec B</m> for the two vectors, as <m> \vec A\cdot\vec B</m>.
	</p> -->

		</caption>
		<image source="./images/vectors/vector-dot-product.png" width="60%"/>
	</figure> -->

	<p>
		Thus scalar product between <m> \vec A </m> and <m> \vec B</m> can be obtained in multiple ways. The following two are very useful for analytical work. 
		<mdn>
			<mrow xml:id="eq-dot-product-from-components"> \vec A \cdot\vec B \amp = A_x B_x + A_y B_y + A_z B_z,</mrow>
			<mrow xml:id="eq-dot-product-from-mag-and-angle">  \amp = A B \cos\theta,</mrow>
		</mdn>
			where <m> A </m> and <m> B </m> are magnitudes of these vectors.
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp A = \sqrt{A_x^2  + A_y^2 + A_z^2}</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp B = \sqrt{B_x^2  + B_y^2 + B_z^2}</mrow>
			</md>
	</p>
	<p>					
		An important use of these formulas to find the angle between two vectors, given their components. Equating these Eqs. <xref ref="eq-dot-product-from-components"/> and <xref ref="eq-dot-product-from-mag-and-angle"/>, and solving for <m> \cos\theta </m> we get
		<men>
			\cos\theta = \dfrac{A_x B_x + A_y B_y + A_z B_z}{A\, B}.
		</men>
		Since components are simple numbers, their multiplication order does not matter, i.e., <m>A_xB_x = B_xA_x</m>, therefore, the order of vectors in the dot product does not matter. That is,
		<men>
			\vec A \cdot \vec B = \vec B \cdot \vec A.
		</men> 
		This will not be the case with the other product between vectors, called cross product, we will define below - we will find that reversing the order introduces a negative sign.

				Since we already have magnitudes of the two vectors, we need to figure out angle between them if they are drawn with their tails at the same point. You can draw to find that the angle between them is <m>\theta = 90^\circ+30^\circ=120^\circ</m>. Therefore,

 				The scalar product is also equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors times the cosine of the angle between the two.  Therefore, the angle <m>\theta</m> between two vectors <m>\vec A</m>  and <m>\vec B</m> can be obtained from the scalar product and the magnitudes of the two vectors by the following formula.

 				(a) Here <m>|\vec A|</m> = <m>\sqrt{(10\ \textrm{N})^2 + (-5\ \textrm{N})^2 }</m> = <m>11.2\ \textrm{N}</m>, and <m>|\vec B|</m> = <m>\sqrt{(3\ \textrm{m})^2 + (4\ \textrm{m})^2 }</m> = <m>5\ \textrm{m}</m>. We have already found that <m>\vec A\cdot \vec B = -7 \ \textrm{N.m}</m>.  Therefore,
