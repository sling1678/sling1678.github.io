	<introduction>
		<p>
			Work has a different meaning in physics than it has in everyday life.  In physics we say that a force has done work on an object if it has caused the object to move.  There are several good examples of work observed in everyday life - a weightlifter lifting a barbell, a lift pulling passengers up to higher floors, a tugboat pulling a ship, a student lifting a backpack full of books upon his shoulders, etc. In each case a work is done when a force is exerted on an object to cause its displacement.

			Previously, when we studied Newton's second law of motion in the impulse-momentum form, we found that impulse was a cumulative effect of force over a period of time that informed us how much momentum would change due to a force. Work is similarly a cumulative impact of a force on the motion, but instead of accumulating over time, we accumulate the impact of the force over the path of the motion. 
		</p>

			The fundamental definition of work relies on Calculus, but work by a constant force can be defined without the need of Calculus. We will see both ways below. We will also derive a result called the work-energy theorem that will tell us what kind of change on motion that work causes.
