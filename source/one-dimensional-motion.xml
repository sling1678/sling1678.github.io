	<introduction>
		<p>
			We start our long journey in physics by laying out foundations of the most basic of all physics - the physics of motion. In this chapter we will look at motion along a straight path, such as a car on a straight road.

			Motion is the study of moving objects. However, to describe motion, you need to be able to tell distance and direction from another object or place and be able to tell time. We say that motion is fundamentally relative, i.e., relative to a reference point. We take reference, itself to be fixed in time, and tell motion of the object under study by noting whether distance and direction in relation to the reference is changing in time.
