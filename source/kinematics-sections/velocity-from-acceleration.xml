		<!-- <p>
			Often acceleration at each instant of an interval is known, and we want know the change in velocity during that interval. Just like getting change in position from velocity, this is also an integration or area-under-the-curve problem.  
		</p> -->
		<p>
			Acceleration and velocity have the same mathematical relation as velocity and position do. 
			<men>
				\vec a = \frac{d\vec v}{dt }\ \ \leftrightarrow \ \ \vec v = \frac{d\vec r}{dt }.
			</men>
			Therefore, as in the last section <xref ref="kinematics-Displacement-from-Velocity"/>, formally, change in velocity vector will be related to the integration of acceleration over time.
			<men>
				\vec v_f - \vec v_i = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} \vec a(t) dt.
			</men>
			This formal relation can be given more calculational interpretation when we look at the components of this equation.
			<mdn>
				<mrow xml:id="change-in-vx-equal-integral-of-ax"> \amp v_{f,x} - v_{i,x} = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} a_x(t) dt, </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp v_{f,y} - v_{i,y} = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} a_y(t) dt, </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp v_{f,z} - v_{i,z} = \int_{t_i}^{t_f} a_z(t) dt. </mrow>
			</mdn>
			The right side of these equations for components, can be computed from plots of corresponding acceleration component versus time by using the "area-under-plot" and "negative-area-over-plot" interpretation of an integral.

				We can understand Eq. <xref ref="change-in-vx-equal-integral-of-ax"/> in a plot of <m>a_x</m> vs <m>t</m> as well. Since <m>a_x</m> is constant, the product <m>a_x \Delta t</m> is just the area under the plot of <m>a_x</m> vs <m>t</m>. This gives us following general rule, which also applies to varying <m>a_x</m>.

			If <m>a_x</m> is negative, then this would be area <alert>above</alert> the plot since <m>a_x=0</m> line would be above the plot. In this case area will be negative.

			The procedure clearly extends to <m> y </m> and <m> z </m> components as well. Once we know the change along different directions, we can combine the components to obtain the magnitude and direction of <m>\Delta \vec v</m>, as usual for vector quantities.

		<statement>
			<p>
				A hockey puck is shot on a surface that has different roughness at different places. As a result its acceleration  varies from place to place.  By placing the <m>x</m>-axis on the line of motion of the puck, we cast the acceleration vector in terms of its <m>x</m>-component which can be plotted with time.  Note the acceleration vector cannot be plotted, since they are not ordinary functions; only the components can be plotted. The resulting <m>x</m>-component of the acceleration is shown <xref ref="fig-exer-var-accln-5"/>. The <m>y</m>  and <m>z</m>-components of the acceleration are zero.  The puck has a velocity  at <m>t = 5</m> sec of <m>2</m> m/s towards the positive <m>x</m> axis.  Find the initial velocity of the puck at <m>t = 0</m>.
