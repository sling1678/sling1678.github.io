			You know that you can make your car move from rest, speed up, slow down and bring to rest, or turn a corner. These are examples of changing velocity, either by changing magnitude or changing itd direction or both. The rate at which velocity, either speed or direction or both, changes is called <term> acceleration</term>.

	<subsection> <title> Average Acceleration </title> <idx><h>Acceleration
</h><h>Average</h></idx>
		<p>
			Suppose we are looking at what happens to velocity during an interval from <m> t_i </m> to <m> t_ f </m>. Let the instantaneous velocity (vector) at  <m> t_i </m> be <m> \vec v_i </m> and at  <m> t_f </m> be <m> \vec v_f </m>. Then, average acceleration is defined by
			<men xml:id="eq-average-accln-0">
				\vec a_{\text{av}} = \dfrac{\vec v_f - \vec v_i}{t_f - t_i}.
			</men>
			We often use symbol <m>\Delta \vec v</m> to denote the change in velocity. Here,
			<men>
				\Delta \vec v = \vec v_f - \vec v_i.
			</men>
			Writing the intertval of time as <m>\Delta t</m>, we write the definition of average acceleration more succinctly as
			<men xml:id="eq-average-accln">
				\vec a_{\text{av}} = \dfrac{\Delta \vec v}{\Delta t}.
			</men>
			Since we are dividing a vector <m>\Delta \vec v</m> by a number <m>\Delta t</m>, average acceleration is also a vector. The direction of <m>\vec a_{\text{av}}</m> will be in the direction of change in velocity <m>\Delta \vec v</m>. In particular, the direction of acceleration has nothing to do with direction of velocity at any one instant, but instead with the <alert>change in velocity</alert>, i.e, how velocity of changing. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<xref ref="fig-average_acceleration_direcitons_in_circular_motion"/> shows an object moving in a circle with constant speed of <m>5\text{ m/s}</m>. In (a), we see that the change in velocity between A and B points of the circle are neither in the direction of <m>\vec v_A</m> nor in the direction of <m>\vec v_B</m>, but its own direction as shown by vector <m>(\vec v_B - \vec v_A)</m>. Since the change in velocity is not zero, the object's average acceleration between A and B is not zero. In (b), another construction for change in velocity during B and C is shown. Try to draw for what happens between C and D and betwen D and A.

		</figure>
		<p>
			Just as with other vector quantities, we can analyze average acceleration in terms of its Cartesian components, <m>a_{av,x} </m>, <m>a_{av,y} </m>, and <m>a_{av,z} </m>. From these components, you can find the magnitude and direction of the acceleration vector.

			<p> 
				It is always a good idea to sketch the vector on a coordinate system where the tail of the vector is at the origin. This gives us a good idea of positive and negative values for the components. In <xref ref="fig-problem-accln-vector-a-and-b"/>(a) below, we will find that both components are negative. If you draw the figure differently, as in (b), you might find the signs to come out differently.

			<p>
				Let <m> a </m> be the magnitude of the acceleration. Using trig in <xref ref="fig-problem-accln-vector-a-and-b"/>(a), we find <m> a_x = - a \cos\, 15^{\circ}</m><m>=-2.41\text{ m/s}</m>, and <m> a_x = - a \sin\, 15^{\circ}</m><m>=-0.65\text{ m/s}</m>. Using Fig. (b), we get the sign of <m> a_x </m> changed to positive now. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This exercise illustrates that, although the physical description of acceleration, namely, <m> 2.5 \text{ m/s}^2</m> down the slope is unique, the components depend upon how you draw the physical situation and the coordinates. This point is further explored in part (b) of this problem.

	<subsection> <title> Instantaneous Acceleration - Formal Definition</title>
	<idx><h>Acceleration</h><h>Instantaneous</h></idx>
		<p></p>
		<p>
			Average acceleration defined above does not tell us about moment-by-moment acceleration. For that Isaac Newton, introduced the concept of <term>instantaneous acceleration</term>, or more siply <term>acceleration</term>, based on concepts of limit and infinitesimal intervals, as we have done for instantaneous velocity.  
		</p>

		<p>
			If you find average acceleration using Eq. <xref ref="eq-average-accln"/> for different interval values, i.e., different values of <m>\Delta t</m>, you will find that you get different velocities as was illustrated for a circular motion. Newton noticed that, when <m>\Delta t</m> becomes increasingly small, the differences in average acceleration so-obtained become less and less in a well-defined way such that it is possible to define a unique acceleration in the limit <m>\Delta t\rightarrow 0</m>. 
			Denoting the instantaneous acceleration vector by <m> \vec a </m> and instantaneous velocity vector as <m> \vec v</m> we can write the definition of instantaneous velocity formally by
			<men xml:id="eq-instantaneous-acceleration-3d-limit">
				\vec a	= \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{\vec v\left(\text{at } (t+\Delta t)\right) - \vec v\left(\text{at } t\right)}{\Delta t} \equiv \frac{d\vec r}{dt}.
			</men> 
			Unlike the magnitude of instantaneous velocity, which is called speed, the magnitude of instantaneous acceleration does not have any special name. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Eq. <xref ref="eq-instantaneous-acceleration-3d-limit" /> is an abstract definition, which we can make more accessibale by looking at the components. Denoting <m>\vec v\left(\text{at } (t+\Delta t)\right) - \vec v\left(\text{at } t\right)</m> by <m>\Delta \vec v \equiv (\Delta v_x, \Delta v_y, \Delta v_z)</m>.

			<md>
				<mrow> \amp a_x= \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\dfrac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t} \equiv \frac{dv_x}{dt},</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp a_y= \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\dfrac{\Delta v_y}{\Delta t} \equiv \frac{dv_y}{dt},</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp a_z= \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\dfrac{\Delta v_z}{\Delta t} \equiv \frac{dv_z}{dt}.</mrow>
			</md>
			These components of acceleration are also called <m>x</m>-, <m>y</m>-, and <m>z</m>-accelerations respectively. In a previous chapter, we have studied one-dimensional motion, where only one of them was non-zero. For general motion, you can expect all of them to be nonzero and you would need to keep track of them all. 			
		</p>
	</subsection>



	<subsection><title> Acceleration from Slopes of <m> (v_x,\ v_y,\ v_z) </m> vs <m> t </m> Plots.</title>

		<p>
			Acceleration at an instant, also called the instantaneous acceleration, is the rate at which velocity is changing with time. In one-dimensional situation, we analyzed by only <m>x</m> component of acceleration for motion along <m>x</m>-axis. Analytically, this was given by the derivative of <m>v_x</m>, the <m>x</m>-component of velocity.
			<me>
				a_x = \dfrac{dv_x}{dt}.
			</me>
			Since derivate of a function also equals slope of a graph of that function, we had used <m>v_x</m> versus <m>t</m> plot to find <m>a_x</m> when using graphical method.
			<me>
				a_x= \text{Slope of tangent to } v_x \text{ versus } t \text{ plot}.
			</me>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, with acceleration possible along arbitrary directions, we can choose to analyze using all three Cartesian directions and  calculate derivatives from the slopes of appropriate plots. Thus,
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp a_x= \text{Slope of tangent to } v_x \text{ versus } t \text{ plot}.</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp a_y= \text{Slope of tangent to } v_y \text{ versus } t \text{ plot}.</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp a_z = \text{Slope of tangent to } v_z \text{ versus } t \text{ plot}.</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
		<p>
			Once we have obtained <m> (a_x,\ a_y,\ a_z)</m>, we can deduce the magnitude and direction of the acceleration vector as usual. For instance, magnitude of acceleration will be
			<men>
				a = \sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2},
			</men>
			and the direction will be given by one angle if the motion is 2-dimensional or by two angles if the motion is 3-dimensional.
