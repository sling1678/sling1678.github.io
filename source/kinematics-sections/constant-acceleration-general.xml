	<introduction>
		<!-- <p>
			Constant acceleration motion plays an important role in physics. Even when acceleration is not constant, treating the motion by using average acceleration can at times give us a rough idea of physical possibilities in the situation.
		</p> -->
		<p>
			In this section, we will study standard examples of constant acceleration such as free flights of projectiles near the surface of the Earth (or any other planet) and boxes sliding frictionlessly on inclined planes. 
			<!-- But before you go through the numerical exercises, it will be helpful to get a broader picture presented below. -->
		</p>
		<p>
			Constant acceleration means both magnitude and direction of the acceleration vector are unchanging <term>during</term> the interval of interest. If acceleration changes at any instant, we must stop our analysis by constant-accceleration methods at <alert> an instant before</alert> that happens. For instance, when we are looking at a falling ball, our final instant of time will be the instant before the ball hits the ground. Similarly, when we are tossing a ball, the initial instant will be an instant after the ball has left the hand.
		</p>
		<!-- <p>
			The direction of acceleration is a special direction in this setting. Therefore, it is common practice to point one of the Cartesian axes, say <m>x</m> axis in the direction of the acceleration, as we will see below.
		</p> -->
	</introduction>
	<subsection><title>The Plane of Constant Acceleration Motion </title>
		<p>
			Since the direction of acceleration is a special fixed direction in space for a constant acceleration situation, we usually direct one of the Cartesian axes in the direction of the aceleration or exactly opposite to it. This way, you can <alert> always</alert> have the entire motion in the <m> xy</m>-plane by choosing your <m> x</m> and <m> y </m> axes appropriately as shown in <xref ref="fig-choosing-xy-plane"/>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This is possible due to the fact that if your <m> a_z = 0 </m>, then <m> v_x </m> and <m> v_z </m> will not change during the motion. Furthermore, if <m>v_z=0</m> intitially, then it will remain zero and hence <m>z</m>-motion will be trivial, keeping the object confined to the <m> xy</m>-plane. 
		</p>




 
		<!-- <p>
			To get a coordinate system in which both <m> v_z = 0 </m> and <m> a_z = 0 </m>,  we will choose the <m> z</m>-axis to be perpendicular to both the initial velocity and acceleration vectors. This will ensure that the motion will occur in the <m> xy</m>-plane.
		</p>
 
		<p>
			To simplify algebra further, we will choose either the <m>x</m> axis or the <m> y </m> axis in the direction of the acceleration vector. This simplifies <m> \vec  a</m> to have only one non-zero component. That means the motion in the other axis will be a simple constant velocity motion.
		</p> -->
		<p>
			Even more simplification can occur if we choose the origin of the coordinate system to be the location of the object at the initial instant of interest, making 
			<me>
				x_{i} = 0,\ \ y_{i} = 0.
			</me>

	<subsection> <title> Constant Acceleration Along <m> x </m> Axis </title>
 		<p>
 			Suppose an object, say a baseball, is moving at constant acceleration of magnitude <m> a</m> during <m> t=t_i</m> and <m> t=t_f</m>. We wish to address the following question.
 		</p>
 		<p>
 			If position and velocity at <m> t_i </m> are <m> \vec r_i </m> and <m> \vec v_i </m>, what will be the position and velocity, <m> \vec r_f </m> and <m> \vec v_f </m>, at <m> t_f </m>?
 		</p>

 		<p>
 			From our discusssion above, we already, know that we can choose <m> x</m> and <m> y</m> axes so that <m> \vec a </m> and <m> \vec v_i</m> are in the <m> xy</m>-plane. By choosing <m> x</m> to be along the acceleration and origin at the initial position, we will have the following.
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp \vec a = (a_x, 0) = (a,0)</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \vec v_i = \left(v_{i,x}, v_{i,y}\right)</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \vec r_i = (0, 0)</mrow>
			</md>
			Similarly, we write the position and velocity at final instant in  components.
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp \vec r_f = (x_f, y_f)</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \vec v_f = \left(v_{f,x}, v_{i,y}\right)</mrow>
			</md>
			For the same of brevity we also denote the duration <m> t_i</m> to <m> t_f </m> by <m> t</m> rather than <m> \Delta t</m>.
			<me>
					\Delta t = t_f - t_i \equiv t,
			</me>
			For the same reason, we will use a simpler notation for the displacement.
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp x \equiv \Delta x  = x_f - x_i = x_f,</mrow>
				<mrow> \amp y \equiv \Delta y  = y_f - y_i = y_f.</mrow>
			</md>		
 		</p>

		<p><alert>Separate <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> <q>Worlds</q>. </alert></p>
		<p> 
			Now, collecting <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> components in separate sets along with the time duration, we get two sets of quantities.
			<mdn>
				<mrow>\amp x,\ v_{i,x},\ v_{f,x},\ a_x=a,\ t, </mrow>
				<mrow>\amp y,\ v_{i,y},\ v_{f,y},\ a_y=0,\ t. </mrow>
			</mdn>

		</p>
		<p>
 			The <m> x </m> quantities do not depend on the <m> y </m> quantities, and vice-versa, except for the value of time <m>t</m> they share. Furthermore, <m> x </m> quantities are simply one-dimensional constant acceleration motion and <m> y </m> quantities are  constant velocity motion. We have already studied them in the context of one-dimensional motions. Therefore, we just summarize the equations we got before.

		<p>
			You have studied what happens in a free fall when you toss a projectile vertically. It just goes up and then comes down with a constant acceleration of magnitude <m> g</m> pointed in straight down direction. When you toss a projectile at an angle, it still has the same acceleration of magnitude <m> g</m> pointed down, but the projectile also moves in the horizontal direction as shown in <xref ref="fig-projectile-motion-path"/>. This motion is called a <term> projectile motion</term>.

				Set up of a projectile motion.

			<image source="./images/two-dim-motion/projectile-motion-path.png" width="90%"/>
		</figure>
		
		<p>
			We could choose an axis that has positive <m> x </m> axis down so that <m> a_x = g</m> and <m> a_y = 0</m>. If we do that, we can just use the formulas above for this value of <m> a_x</m>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			However, traditionally, projectile motion is solved using <m> y</m> coordinate pointed up as shown in <xref ref="fig-projectile-motion-path"/>. This gives us <m> a_x = 0</m> and <m> a_y = -g</m>, completely switching the roles of <m> x </m> and <m> y</m> axes we used above. Additionally, we get a minus sign. Making these adjustments we get the following formulas, where <m>t=t_f-t_i,\ x=x_f-x_i,\ y=y_f-y_i</m>.

	<subsection> <title> Equations of Constant Acceleration Motion - Derivation </title>
		<p> <alert> Most of the derivations are simple algebra with one Calculus step. If you are not in a Calculus-based course, you can just use the result of the Calculus step as given.</alert>
		</p>
		<p>
			Let <m> \vec a </m> be constant during in the interval <m> (t_i, t_f) </m> of interest. That is, both its magnitude and direction are fixed during <m> t=t_i</m> to  <m> t=t_f</m>. Let us choose <m>x</m> axis so that positive <m>x</m> axis is pointed in the same direction as the direction of the acceleration. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			Let <m> \vec v_i </m> denote the (instantaneous) velocity at <m> t=t_i</m>. We now choose the <m> y </m> axis so that <m> \vec v_i </m> and <m> \vec a </m> are in the <m>xy</m>-plane. Then, the velocity component in <m> z </m> direction, viz. <m> v_z </m>, will stay zero and therefore, we can ignore <m> z </m> axis completely. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, that we have choosen the direction of the Cartesian axes, we choose the location of the origin. We place the origin at the point where the object was at the initial instant <m> t = t_i </m>. This makes the initial position a zero vector. Restricting to <m> xy</m>-plane, it is <m> \vec r_i = (0, 0) </m>, meaning <m> x_i = 0,\ y_i = 0</m>. Of course <m> z_i = 0</m> also, but we are ignoring <m> z </m> axis completely, so it does not matter.
		</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>
			With these choices, we have simple component representations of acceleration, initial velocity, and initial position.
			<mdn>

		</p>
		<p> The equations of constant acceleration give us the relation between the position and velocity at as arbitrary instant <m> t </m> to the initial position, initial velocity, and acceleration. 
		</p>
		<p> Let us denote the position and velocity at intant <m> t </m> which is some instant between <m> t_i </m> and <m> t_f </m> by 
			<mdn>
				<mrow> \amp \vec r = (x, y)  </mrow>
				<mrow> \amp \vec v = (v_x, v_y)  </mrow>
			</mdn>
			From constant acceleration between <m>t_i</m> and <m>t</m> we can immediately write the change in velocity equation over the duration <m>t_i</m> to <m>t</m>. Formally,
			<men>
				\vec v - \vec v_i = \vec a\, \left( t - t_i \right),

				<mrow> \amp v_x - v_{i,x} =  a_x \, \left( t - t_i \right)</mrow>
				<mrow>  \amp  v_y - v_{i,y} = a_y \, \left( t - t_i \right)</mrow>

				<mrow xml:id="eq-const-accl-vy">  \amp  v_y - v_{i,y} = 0\ \ \rightarrow\ \ v_y = v_{i,y}.</mrow>
			</mdn>
			This clearly says that  the velocity component does not change in the axis direction (here <m> y</m> axis) in which acceleration is zero. The quantity <m> v_x </m> is changing with <m> t</m> since there is an acceleration along this axis. 
		</p>
		<p> <alert> Calculus Step:  </alert>
			Now, integrating <m> v_x </m> and <m> v_y </m> from <m> t = t_i</m> to <m> t=t </m> we can find the changes in <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> during this time.

		<p> <alert> Summary: </alert>
			These equations become simpler if we enforce <m> x_i = y_i = 0 </m> from the choice of the origin and by choosing to call time for initial instant to be zero,  <m> t_i = 0</m>.

			<p> 
				This motion is on only one axis. So, let us use <m> x </m> axis for that with the origin at the starting place, and positive <m>x </m> axis pointed in the direction of the runner's motion, which is also the direction of his acceleration here. With this choice, we do not need the axis of the constant velocity motion. We also set <m> t_i = 0</m> and <m> t_f = t</m>.

				<me>
					 x_f  = x_i + v_{i,x}\, t + \frac{1}{2}\, a_x\, t^2,

				<md>
					<mrow> \amp a_y = -9.81 \text{ m/s}^2,\ \ v_{i,y} = + 29.43\ \text{ m/s} </mrow>

				The following quantities are not known:
				<md>
					<mrow> t = t_f-t_i,\ \ y_{f},</mrow>

				where <m> y_f -y_i </m> is the total height the ball flew. We now notice that we can get <m> t </m> from using Eq. <xref ref="eq-problem-vertical-motion-vt"/>, which we can use in the other equation to get <m> y_f </m>.
				<me>
					 0 = 29.43 + (-9.81)\, t\ \ \longrightarrow \ \ t = 3.0.
				</me>
				Hence, it takes <m> 3.0\text{ sec}</m> to get to the top of the trajectory. Using this value in Eq. <xref ref="eq-problem-vertical-motion-yt" /> we get
				<me>
					y_f = 0 + 29.43 \times 3.0 + \frac{1}{2}\, (-9.81)\times 3.0^2 = 44.
				</me>
				Therefore, the ball flies to a height of <m>44\text{ m}</m>.


			</p>
			    
			<p><alert>Why is <m> v_y = 0 </m> at the highest point?</alert></p>
			<p>
			 	We notice that just before the ball reaches the highest point, the <m>y</m> component of its velocity <m>(v_y)</m> is positive, but immediartely after the highest point, <m> v_y </m> is negative. Since velocity components must be continuous functions of time (otherwise acceleration will not be defined), the only way they can turn from positive number to negative number is that they go through zero. That means that at the highest point <m> v_y = 0</m>

					Writing <m> x </m> for <m> x_f</m>, <m> y </m> for <m> y_f</m>, and <m> t </m> for <m> t_f</m>, we found the following for <m> x </m> and <m> y</m> of the ball.
					<md>
						<mrow> \amp x = 19 t, </mrow>
						<mrow> \amp y = 11\, t -   4.905\, t^2. </mrow>
					</md>
					We can solve the first equation for <m> t </m> and use that in the second equation to get an equation relating <m> x </m> to <m> y </m>.
					<me>
						y = \dfrac{11}{19}\, x -   4.905\times  \left( \dfrac{1}{19} \right)^2\, x^2
					</me>
					Simplifying we get the equation of the trajectory to be
					<me>
						y = 0.58\, x - 0.014\, x^2.

		<exercise xml:id="ex-The-Range-and-Hang-Time-of-a-Projectile"><title> The Range and Hang Time of a Projectile </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A projectile is launched at an angle <m>\theta</m> above the horizontal direction with speed <m>v_0</m>. The projectile lands at the same height after flying freely under gravity with acceleration due to gravity <m> g</m>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					(a) How far will it go in the horizontal direction? This is called <term> range</term> of the projectile.
				</p>
				<p>
					(b) How long was the ball in the air? This is called the <term> hang time</term>.
				</p>

			</statement>
			<hint> <p>  Set up <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> equations. </p> </hint>
			<answer> <p>  (a) <m> \dfrac{v_0^2}{g}\,\sin\,2\theta</m>, (b) <m> \dfrac{2}{g}\,v_0\,\sin\,\theta</m>. </p> </answer>
			<solution> 
				<p>
					We use <m> x</m> axis horizontally and <m> y</m> axis vertically up as shown in <xref ref="fig-ex-The-Range-and-Hang-Time-of-a-Projectile"/>.
				</p>

				<p>



					Let <m> D</m> denote the range and <m> T</m> the hang time. The useful <m> x </m> and <m> y </m> equations are
					<md>
						<mrow> \amp x\text{-eq: }\ \ D = T\, v_0\,\cos\,\theta, </mrow>
						<mrow> \amp y\text{-eq: }\ \ 0 = T\, v_0\,\sin\,\theta -\dfrac{g}{2}\, T^2, </mrow>
					</md>
					From the  <m> y</m>-eq, we get two values for <m> T</m>.
					<me>
						T = 0,\ \dfrac{2}{g}\,v_0\,\sin\,\theta,
					</me>
					where <m> T=0</m> is for the starting place and not of interest. 
					<me>
						T = \dfrac{2}{g}\,v_0\,\sin\,\theta.
					</me>
					Now, we use this in the <m>x</m>-eqn to get 
					<me>
						D  = \dfrac{v_0^2}{g}\,\sin\,2\theta.
					</me>

		<exercise xml:id="ex-projectile-shot-on-an-incline"><title>(Calculus) Practice with a Friend: Range of a Projectile Fired on an Incline</title>

			<statement>
				<sidebyside widths="50% 5% 45%">
					<p>
						A cannon ball is fired up an inclined road as shown in <xref ref="fig-projectile-shot-on-an-incline"/>. The initial speed of the ball is fixed at <m>v_0</m>, but its direction can be changed by changing <m>\theta</m> of the the barrel. The projectile lands at a distance <m>D</m> on the incline. 
					</p>
					<p></p>

						<image source="./images/two-dim-motion/projectile-shot-on-an-incline.png" width="70%" />
					</figure>
				</sidebyside>
				<p>
					(a) Find angle <m>\theta</m> that will give the maximum range, i.e., largest value of <m>D</m>. (b) What is the largest <m>D</m> that can be achieved.
				</p>
				<p>Answer Hint: When <m>\alpha=15^\circ</m>, <m>\theta_\text{max} = 37.5^\circ</m>.</p>
			</statement>
			<hint>
				<p>
					Try a coordinate system with <m>x</m>-axis up the incline and <m>y</m>-axis perpendicular to that. This will give you <m>a_x</m> and <m>a_y</m> both non-zero. Also, keep your calculations in <m>v_{0x}</m>, <m>v_{0y}</m>, <m>a_x</m>, and <m>a_y</m> till the end to keep the calcualtion from getting cluttered with too  many symbols. Last steps may have tangents and cotangents.
