	<problem><title> Change in Velocity from Area Under Curve of Acceleration vs Time</title>
				<statement>
			<p>
				A skydiver's acceleration changes as the parachute opens up.  A coordinate with <m>y</m> axis pointed vertically up is used to record the acceleration of the skydiver. The skydiver exits from an air plane at vertical velocity component zero.  She opens her parachute after <m>10 \text{ sec}</m>. We will assume that parachute opens instantaneously at <m>10 \text{-sec}</m> second mark. For the first <m>10\text{ sec}</m> the acceleration of the parachuter is <m>7 \text{m/s}^2</m> pointed down.  After the parachute opens at the <m>10\text{-sec}</m> mark, the <m>y</m> component of the acceleration comes to zero in another <m>20 \text{ sec}</m>  as shown in <xref ref="fig-varying-acceleration-avst-5"/>.  Find the velocity of the parachuter at (a) <m>t = 10 \text{ sec}</m>, (b) <m>t = 30 \text{sec}</m>?

		<hint> <p>  Use area under the curve. </p> </hint>
		<answer> <p> (a) <m>-70\text{ m/s}</m>, (b) <m>140\text{ m/s}</m>.  </p> </answer>
		<solution><title>a</title> 
			<p>
				The area under the curve method for the changing acceleration can be applied to determine the change in velocity over any period. Part (a) is actually over an interval where the acceleration is constant.  Therefore, for part (a) we could use either the constant acceleration equations or the area under the <m>a</m> vs <m>t</m> method.  For part (b) we cannot use the constant acceleration formulas and must resort to variable acceleration method.
			</p>
			<p>
				(a) The area under the curve method can be applied to the the segment of curve from <m>t=0</m> to <m>t=10 \text{ sec}</m>.  The area is that of a rectangle with one side equal to <m>-7 \text{ m/s}^2</m> and the other side equal to <m>10 \text{ sec}</m>.  Therefore, the area is <m>-70 \text{ m/s}</m>, which is the change in the velocity of the parachuter. Since the initial velocity of the parachuter is given to be zero, the velocity at <m>10\text{ sec}</m> mark is <m>-70\text{ m/s}</m>.  The negative sign correctly gives the direction as pointed down since pointed up has been taken to be the positive direction. We can verify that we get the same result from using constant acceleration equations. Here <m>v_0=0</m>, <m>t=10\text{ sec}</m>, <m>a=-7\text{ m/s}^2</m>.  Therefore <m>v=v_0+at</m> gives <m>v=-70\text{ m/s}</m>, same as the area under the curve method.
			</p>
		</solution>
		<solution><title>b</title>
			<p>
				(b) This part has variable acceleration, so it would be mistake to use constant acceleration formulas. The area is that of a triangle of height <m>-7\text{ m/s}^2</m> and the base equal to <m>20\text{ sec}</m>.  The area is <m>-7\times 20/2 = -70\text{ m/s}</m>.  Therefore, the change in velocity in the time <m>10\text{ sec}</m> to <m>30\text{ sec}</m> is also <m>-70\text{ m/s}</m>.  Since the velocity at the beginning of this interval was also <m>-70\text{ m/s}</m>, the velocity at the end of the interval will be <m>(-70\text{ m/s}) + (-70\text{ m/s})</m>, or <m>-140\text{ m/s}</m>.  Thus, velocity at time <m>t=30\text{ sec}</m> is <m>140\text{ m/s}</m> pointed down.

					Suppose you live on the <m>5^{\text{th}}</m> floor of a tall building. Your friend goes to the roof and drops a steel ball from rest while you time the ball as it falls.

					Square these and subtract to get
					<me>
						g^2 \left( T_1^2 - T_2^2 \right) = 4\left( v_1^2 - v_2^2\right).
					</me>
					Now using <m>v_1^2</m> and <m>v_2^2</m> from Eqs. <xref ref="eq-prob-kin-8-speed-height-1"/> and <xref ref="eq-prob-kin-8-speed-height-2"/>, we will get
					<me>
						g^2 \left( T_1^2 - T_2^2 \right) = 8\, g\, \left(H_2  - H_1\right).
					</me>
					Therefore,
					<me>
						g = \dfrac{ 8\, \left(H_2  - H_1\right) }{ T_1^2 - T_2^2 }.

		<!-- <problem><title>  Insect Flying Between Two Walls - SolutionTODO</title>
			<statement>

				<p>
					An insect flies at a constant speed between two moving walls that are initially a distance <m>D</m> apart with the insect  near one wall.  The insect goes from one wall to the other and back without losing anytime in the turn around, and does this continuously.  If both the walls move right with a constant speed <m>u</m> with respect to the floor and the insect's speed be <m>v</m>, find the distance the insect has traveled by the <m>N^{\text{th}}</m> turn around.  Assume that at <m>t= 0</m> the insect is moving to the right from its position just to the right of the left wall. Think of other variations of this problem, and work them out for fun.
