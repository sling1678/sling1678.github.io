		<statement>
			<p>
				Three runners A, B, and C are running on a straight East-West road.  Runners A and B have velocities <m>\{ 5\ \text{m/s},\ \text{East}\}</m> and  <m>\{ 2\ \text{m/s},\ \text{West}\}</m>, respectively,  with respect to runner C. What is the relative velocity of the runner A with respect to the runner B?
			</p>

		</statement>
		<hint> <p> Be mindful of vector nature of velocity.  </p> </hint>
		<answer> <p> <m> 7\text{ m/s}</m> due East with respect to B.  </p> </answer>
		<solution> 
			<p>
				It is best to perform the calculation analytically in a Cartesian coordinate system. Let the positive <m>x</m>-axis of the runner C be pointed towards East. Then, we can write the velocities of runners A and B in this frame.
				<md>
					<mrow> \amp \vec v_A = (5\ \text{m/s})\hat i, </mrow>
					<mrow> \amp \vec v_B = (-2\ \text{m/s})\hat i. </mrow>
				</md>
				The relative velocity of A with respect to B will be <m>\vec v_A - \vec v_B</m> will be
				<me>
					\vec v_A - \vec v_B = (5\ \text{m/s})\hat i - (-2\ \text{m/s})\hat i = (7\ \text{m/s})\hat i.
				</me>
				Therefore, the velocity of A is <m>7</m> m/s towards the East with respect to B.

		<statement>
			<sidebyside widths="55% 5% 40%">
				<p>
					A train has velocity <m> 20 \text{ m/s}</m> in the direction <m> 30^{\circ} </m> North of East. A car has velocity <m> 30 \text{ m/s}</m> in the North direction. These velocities are given with respect to someone who is not moving with respect to the ground. What is the velocity of the train observed by the driver of the car? If you need to use a coordinate system, take your positive <m> x </m> axis to point towards East and the positive <m> y </m> to point towards North.

		</statement>
		<hint> <p> If <m> \vec u </m> is the train's velocity and <m> \vec v </m> is the car's velocity, both with respect to the gound, then the train's velocity with respect to the car = <m> \vec v - \vec u</m>. </p></hint>
		<answer> <p> <m> 26.5\text{ m/s}</m>, <m>49^{\circ}</m> South of East.</p> </answer>
		<solution> 
			<p>
				If we think what happens in one second, we will notice that the train will appear South of East as shown in the figure. This tells us that the velocity we want is obtained by subtracting the car's velocity from the train's velocity.
			</p>
			<p>
				Subtraction and addition of vectors is more readily done when we have the vectors in component form. From the figure, we obtain the following component forms for the velocities of train and car, <m> \vec v_t</m> and <m> \vec v_c </m>, respectively, in m/s units.
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> \amp \vec v_t = \left( 20 \cos\, 30^{\circ}, 20 \sin\, 30^{\circ}\right) = (17.32, 10)</mrow>
					<mrow> \amp \vec v_c = \left( 0, 30 \right)</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				Therefore, the components of the velocity of the train with respect to the driver of the car are
				<me>
					\vec v = \vec v_t - \vec v_c = (17.32, -20).
				</me>
				This give the speed <m> \sqrt{17.32^2 + 20^2}\text{ m/s} = 26.5\text{ m/s}</m> in the direction <m> 49^{\circ} </m> South of East, i.e., clockwise (since <m> \arctan(y/x) </m> results in a negative value) from positive <m> x </m> axis into the fourth quadrant.
