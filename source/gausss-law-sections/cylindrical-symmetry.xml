			<xref ref="fig-gauss-law-cylindrical-symmetry"/> below illustrates conditions satisfied by charge distribution that has a cylindrical symmetry. Basically, you should look for following four conditions when you are evaluating whether a given charge distribution has cylindrical symmetry.
			<ol>
				<li> Charges are distributed in an infintiely long cylindrical shape. </li>
				<li> Charge density must not vary along the axis.</li>
				<li>  Charge density must not vary with direction in the plane perpendicular to the axis. </li>
				<li> Charge density can depend upon the distance from the axis of the cylinder. </li>

				Cylindrical symmetry.  To determine if a given charge distribution has a cylindrical symmetry, you look at the cross-section of an <alert>infinitely long cylinder</alert>. If the charge density does not depend on the polar angle of the cross-section or along the axis, then you have a cylindrical symmetry. In (a) charge density is constant in the cylinder, in (b) upper half of the cylinder has a different charge density that the lower half, in (c) left half of the cylinder has a different charge density than the right half, and in (d) charges are constant in different cylindrical rings but the density does not depend on the polar angle. Cases (a) and (d) have cylindrical symmetry, and, (b) and (c) do not.

	<subsection><title> Consequences of Cylindrical Symmetry </title>


		<p>
			When a charge distribution has cylindrical symmetry, there is no preferred direction in the cross-section plane of the cylinder and there is no dependence along axis.  Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field of a cylindrical symmetric situation can only be a function of the distance from the axis of the cylinder.
		</p>
		<sidebyside widths="55% 10% 35%">
			<p>
				The direction of electric field must be perpendicular to the axis. We can see this easily from the way we found electric field of a charged wire in the last chapter. Every charge has a pairing charge in the cylinder that will cancel components of the electric field that are not perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder.

		<p>
			These observations about the expected electric field are best cast in the cylindrical coordinate system illustrated in <xref ref="fig-gauss-cylindrical-coordinates"/>. We use <m>z</m> for the axis and polar coordinates <m>(s,\ \phi) </m> for the radial and azimuthal angles in the <m>xy</m>-plane. We use letter <m>s</m> rather than <m>r</m> for the radial distance, since we would reserve <m>r</m> for spherical radial distance, not radial distance in the <m>xy</m>-plane.
		</p>
		<figure xml:id="fig-gauss-cylindrical-coordinates">

				The cylindrical coordinates consist of polar coordinates <m> (s,\ \phi)</m> in the cross-section plane of the cylinder and a Cartesian axis <m>(z)</m> along the axis of the cylinder.

			<image source="./images/gausss-law/cylindrical-coordinates.png" width="60%"/>

		<p>
			Using cylindrical coordinates, we can assert that in case of cylindrical symmetry, the magnitude of electric field at a point will <em> a function on <m>s</m> only </em>.
			<me>
				E_P = E_P(s),

			and the direction will be along the radial line to the axis, either away from the axis or towards the axis, depending upon the net positive or negative charge. We can include the direction information if we use a unit vector pointed away from the axis. We denote this unit vector by <m>\hat u_s</m>. Then, electric field at P in vector form will be

	 			There are two types of points in this space, where we will find electric field.
	 			<ol>

 			The magnitude of electric field varies with distance by two different rules, one for points inside the sphere and another for point outside the sphere as we will derive below. This is also displayed in <xref ref="fig-gauss-law-e-field-uniform-cylinder"/>.

 			The outside field is often written in terms of charge per unit length of the cylindrical charge. Multiplying <m>\rho_0</m> by <m>\pi R^2</m> will give charge per unit length of the cylinder. We denote this by <m>\lambda</m>. Then, field outside the cylinder will be

 		<subsubsection> <title> Deriving Electric Field at an Outside Point by Gauss's Law</title>

 			<p><alert>Gaussian Surface and Flux</alert></p>
 			<p>
 				As before, I will call electric field at an outside point as <m>E_\text{out}</m>. To show its functional dependence I will write the dependence on cylindrical radial distance <m>s</m> explicitly.
 				<me>
 					E_\text{out} = E_\text{out}(s),
 				</me>
 
 			</p>
 			<p>
				Since in Gauss's law, electric field is inside an integral over a closed surface, we seek a Gaussian surface that contains point <m>P_\text{out}</m>, where magnitude of electric field will not change over the surface. A cylindrical surface about the same axis is a good candidate to explore.
 			</p>
 
	 		<p>
	 			However, unlike the situation with spherical surface, a cylindrical surface has two types of surfaces as shown in <xref ref="fig-gauss-law-surface-for-uniform-cylinder-outside-point"/>- (1) round surface at equal <m>s</m> all around, and (2) the two flat ends, where <m>s</m> goes from zero to the radius of the cylindrical surface.

		 		<p>
		 			The flux in Gauss's law will be a sum of the fluxes on all of these surfaces combined. Fortuantely, the fluxes of the flat ends for cylindrical symmetry electric fields are zero due to the fact that direction of the electric field is along the surface and hence electric field lines do not pierce these surfaces. Another way to look at it is to note that dot product of the area vector and electric field is zero on these flat ends.

	 		<sidebyside widths="60% 5% 35%">
			 	<p>
			 		The flux through the circular part of the cylinder is quite easy to work out since we magnitude of electric field is same at all points, which are  denoting by <m>E_\text{out}(s)</m>, and the direction of electric field at a patch is parallel to the area vector. Using the dot product form of flux, we get

		 		Note that <m>L</m> is the height of the Gaussian cylinder, not that of the charged cylinder, which is infinitely long.
		 	</p>
		 	<p> 
		 		Adding up the fluxes from the round part and the at the flat ends, we get the net flux through a closed surface to be

		 		Now, we find amount of charge enclosed by the closed surface. We notice that only a length <m>L</m> of the charged cylinder is enclosed. Since charge density is constant here, corresponding charge is just the product of charge density and volume.

 		<subsubsection> <title> Deriving Electric Field at an Inside Point by Gauss's Law</title>
 

	 		<sidebyside widths="60% 5% 35%">
			 	<p>
			 		To derive the field at an inside point, we take a Gaussian cylindrical surface whose circular surface contains the field point of interest, i.e., point <m>P_\text{in}</m>. We need to work out flux and enclosed charge here as well. The flux calculation is identical to the calculation given in Eq. <xref ref="eq-gauss-cylinder-outside-flux"/> above for <m>P_\text{out}</m>. 
	 				<me>

			 <p>
			 	For enclosed charge, we note here that, not all charges of the cylinder of length <m>L</m> are enclosed. Only charges upto the radius of <m>s</m> are enclosed. Therefore,
		 		<me>
		 			q_\text{enc} = \rho_0 \times \pi s^2 L.
