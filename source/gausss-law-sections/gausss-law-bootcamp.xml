				<p>
					A point charge <m>q</m> is at the center of a cube of side <m>a</m>.  Find the electric flux through one of its sides.

			<answer> <p> <m>\dfrac{1}{6}\:\dfrac{q}{\epsilon_0}</m>.  </p> </answer>
			<solution>
				<p>
					By Gauss's law, flux through a closed surface equals <m>q_\text{enc}/\epsilon_0</m>. Now, if we consider the surfaces of the cube making a closed surface around the charge at the center,we will have
					<me>
						\Phi_{\text{cube}} = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0}.
					</me>
				</p> 
				<p>
					Since the charge is at the center of the cube,  we can assert that flux through each face of the cube will be same based on the symmetry. 
					<me>
						\Phi_{\text{cube}} = 6\times \Phi_{\text{one face}}.
					</me> 
					Therefore, we will have

			<answer> <p> <m> \dfrac{1}{24}\:\dfrac{q}{\epsilon_0}</m>.  </p> </answer>
			<solution> 
				<p>
					Since the charge is at one corner of the cube, we do not have a symmetry like the one we had when the charge was located at the center of the cube in <xref ref="pr-Flux-Through-One-Side-of-a-Cube-for-Charge-at-the-Center"/>.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, we can imagine adding seven more cubes to form a larger cube of side <m>2a</m> so that the charge now sits at the center of the larger cube.  According to Gauss's law, the electric flux trough the surface of the larger cube will be
					<me>
						\Phi_{\text{larger cube}} = \dfrac{q}{\epsilon_0}.
					</me>
				</p>
	 
				<image source="./images/gausss-law/prob-charge-cube-solution.png" width="40%"/>


				<p>
					Now, there are <m>8</m> smaller cubes, each with <m>3</m> faces in the same symmetric situation. This makes net flux equal to <m>8\times 3=24</m>  times the surface of the original face.  Therefore, flux through the shaded face of the original cube will be
					<me>
						\Phi_{\text{larger cube}} = 24\times \Phi_{\text{shaded face original}}.
					</me>
					Therefore, the flux through the shaded face of the original cube will be
					<me>
					 	\Phi_{\text{shaded face original}} = \dfrac{1}{24}\:\dfrac{q}{\epsilon_0}.

				<p>
					I will work out the numerical problem.

				<p>
					Let <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m> be the distance from the wires to the field point <m>(x,y)</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane .

					Using the formulas for the magnitudes of the electric fields from charges on long wire, which is done by Gauss's law for cyclindrical case, we get

					</md>
					Now we need to add them vectorially. The net field is not just sum of the magnitudes, as you know from vector addition.
					<me>
						E_P \ne E_1 + E_2.
					</me>
					We will first compute <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> components of the two fields so that we can find <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> components of the net field.
					<md>
						<mrow>E_{1x} \amp = E_1\, \dfrac{x+d}{r_1}, </mrow>
						<mrow> \amp = 35,967\text{ N/C}\, \dfrac{3}{5} = 21,580\text{ N/C}, </mrow>

						<mrow> \amp = 35,967\text{ N/C}\, \dfrac{4}{5} = 28,774\text{ N/C}. </mrow>

			<solution> 
				<p>
					Imagine filling the hole with equal and opposite charge with charge densities <m>+\sigma</m> and <m>-\sigma</m>. When we include the small disk of charge   <m>+\sigma</m>  with the rest of the plane, we get one large plane of charge density <m>+\sigma</m>.  The charge compensating disk of charge density <m>-\sigma</m> can be treated as a separate disk. The electric field at point P will be equal to the vector sum of the field of the entire plane and of the disk.
				</p> 

				<image source="./images/gausss-law/prob-plane-hole-solution.png" width="80%"/>
 
				<p>
					We know the formulas for the electric fields  of large uniformly charged plate and of a uniformly charged disk. Here the field from the plane is pointed away from the plane and the field of the disk is towards the plane.
				</p>
				<p>
					With <m>z</m> axis pointed up, the <m>z</m> components of electric fields from plate and disk are
					<md>
						<mrow>  E_{\text{plate},z} \amp = \dfrac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0},</mrow>
					  	<mrow> E_{\text{disk},z} \amp = -\dfrac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\: \left( 1-\dfrac{h}{\sqrt{R^2 + h^2}} \right).</mrow>
					</md>
					Adding these components of fields we obtain the <m>z</m> component of the net electric field.
					<me>
						E_{z} =  \dfrac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\:  \dfrac{h}{\sqrt{R^2 + h^2}}  
					</me>
					Since, the field has only <m>z</m> component, this also is the magnitude of the net electric field. The direction will be away from the plate if <m>\sigma\gt 0</m> and towards the plate if <m>\sigma\lt 0</m>.
