    <title>Energy and Power</title>

    <introduction>
    	<p>
    		Energy is perhaps the most important property of every physical system. In this chapter, we will learn about energy due to motion, also called kinetic energy. We will also study interaction by which energy from one body may be transferred to another body. The energy transfer due to force betwen bodies is called Work. Conservative interactions allow us to introduce a concept of potential energy. We will look at potential energies due to some common forces and discuss conservation of energy. We will also find that energy considerations in collisions give us important information about the collision.
