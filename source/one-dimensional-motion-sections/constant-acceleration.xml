	<p>
		The one-dimensional constant acceleration motion has many applications in practice. For instance, almost all problems of freely falling bodies near Earth is first done by assuming a constant acceleration. As we have done in this chapter, we will remain with one-dimensional situations, e.g., motion along a Cartesian axis, say the <m>x</m> axis.
	</p>
	<p>
		<xref ref="fig-const-accln-notation-diagram"/> illustrates a common setup for a constant-acceleration prblems. We denote the interval by <m> \Delta t = t_f - t_i </m>, the change in position by <m> \Delta x = x_f-x_i </m>, and change in velocity by <m> \Delta v_x = v_{f,x} - v_{i,x} </m>. 
		In these problems, we are typically interested in change in position and velocity over some interval of time. We do not care about what happens AT OTHER INSTANTS as long as acceleration is same at all those instants.

		You can easily see from either thinking in terms of average acceleration or in terms of area-under-the-curve of <m>a_x</m> versus <m>t</m> as shown in <xref ref="fig-dvx-equal-ax-times-dx"/> or integral of a constant <m>a_x</m>. 
		You can also write Eq. <xref ref="eq-dvx-equal-ax-times-dx"/> more explicitly to get the following equation.

		<men>
			 v_{f,x} = v_{i,x} + a_x \left( t_f - t_i \right).
		</men>
		This formula for <m>v_{f,x}</m> will be same for any arbitrary instant <m>t</m> as the final instant. Let us denote by <m>t</m> the time at any arbitrary instant and <m>v_x</m> velocity at this arbitrary instant. Then.
		<men>
			 v_{x} = v_{i,x} + a_x \left( t - t_i \right).
		</men>
		This says that velocity changes linearly with time, i.e., <m>v_x(t)</m> is a linear polynomial of <m>t</m>, i.e., a plot of <m>v_x</m> against time <m>t</m> will be a straight line.
		<me>
			v_x(t) = A + B t,
		</me>
		with
		<me>
			A = v_{i,x} - a_x t_i,\ \ \ B = a_x.
		</me>
	</p>
	<sidebyside widths="50% 50%">

			Therefore, average velocity will simply be the average of initial and final velocities. This is correct only in the case of constant acceleration.
			<men>
				v_{\text{av},x} = \dfrac{v_{i,x} + v_{f,x}}{2}.

		 Now, displacement can be given just by the product of average velocity and duration. Therefore,
		<men>
			\Delta x = v_{\text{av},x} \, \Delta t. 
		</men>		
	</p>
	<p>
		It is possible to eliminate <m> \Delta t </m> from these equations to obtain 
		<men  xml:id="eq-1-d-no-t-equation">
			v_{f,x}^2 = v_{i,x}^2 + 2 a_x \left( \Delta x \right)^2,
		</men>
		which we will refer to as the <q>no-<m>t</m>-equation </q>.
		It is also possible to eliminate <m> v_{f,x} </m> to obtain another useful equation:
		<men  xml:id="eq-1-d-no-vf-equation">
			\Delta x = v_{i,x} \Delta t + \dfrac{1}{2}a_x\left(\Delta t \right)^2,

	<p><alert>Sign conventions.</alert>
		We use a sign convention to follow the directions of velocity and acceleration. The justification of these sign conventions will become clear after you learn vectors. The following diagrams clarify the sign assignments of velocity and acceleration.

			Note that many of these symbols have subscript <m>x</m>. It is not necessary to use subscripts when it is understood that the motion is along one of the Cartesian axis. Therefore, we will often write them without verbose symbols: use <m>a</m>, <m>v_0</m>, <m>v</m>, <m>x</m>, <m>t</m> in place of <m>a_x</m>, <m>v_{i,x}</m>, <m>v_{f,x}</m>, <m>\Delta x</m>, <m>\Delta t</m>, respectively.

			(b) <m>- 0.384\text{ m/s}^2 </m>,

						  </p> </answer>
		<solution> <title>a</title>
			<p> 
				With <m>+x</m> axis in the direction of motion, we have
				<me>
					\Delta x = 120 \text{ m},\ \ v_{fx} = 0,\ \ \Delta t = 25\text{ s}\equiv t.
				</me>
				Using <m>\Delta x = v_{\text{av},x}\, \Delta t </m> and <m> v_{\text{av},x} = (v_{ix}+v_{fx})/2</m>, we get
				<me>
					120\text{ m} = \dfrac{v_{ix} + 0 }{2} \times 25\text{ s}.
				</me>
				Therefore,
				<me>
					v_{ix} = 9.6\text{ m/s}.
				</me>
			</p>
		</solution>
		<solution> <title>b</title>
			<p>
				<me>
					a_x = \dfrac{v_{fx} - v_{ix}}{\Delta t }= \dfrac{ 0 - 9.6 }{25} = - 0.384\text{ m/s}^2.				
				</me>
			</p>
		</solution>
		<solution> <title>c</title>
			<p>
				Now, we have
				<me>
					v_{ix} = 9.6\text{ m/s},\ \ a_x = - 0.384\text{ m/s}^2,\ \ \Delta t = 12.5\text{ s}\equiv t.
				</me>
				Therefore
				<md>
					<mrow> \Delta x \amp = v_{ix} t + \dfrac{1}{2}a_x t^2</mrow>
					<mrow> \amp = 9.6 \times 12.5 + \dfrac{1}{2} \times (-0.384) \times 12.5^2 = 90\text{ m}.</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</solution>
		<solution> <title>d</title>
			<p>
				
				<me> 
					\Delta x = 120\text{ m} - 90\text{ m} = 30\text{ m}.

    <example xml:id="ex-Constant-Acceleration-on-an-Inclined-Plane"> <title> Constant Acceleration on an Inclined Plane</title>
    	<statement>
		    <p>
		    	A truck is parked on an inclined slippery road. Suddenly, the brake fails and the truck starts to slide down the incline. You notice that starting from rest, the truck has picked up a speed of <m>20.0 </m> m/s over a period of <m> 30.0 </m> seconds.
			</p>
			<p>
				(a) Assuming constant acceleration, how far has the truck moved in this time? 
		    </p>
			<p>
				(b) What is the acceleration of the truck?
			</p>
		</statement>
		<!-- <hint> 
			<p>
				Assume <m> x </m> axis down the incline.
			</p>  
		</hint> -->
		<answer>
			<p>
				(a) <m> 300.0 </m> m, (b) <m> 0.67 \text{ m/s}^2</m> pointed down the incline.
			</p>
		</answer>
		<solution> <title>a</title>
			<p>
				Since we have a constant acceleration situation, it is easy to get average velocity from the initial and final velocities. Here, the initial velocity <m> v_i = 0 </m> since the truck was not moving initially, and the final velocity <m> v_f = 20.0 </m> m/s.
				<me> v_{av} = \dfrac{0 + 20.0}{2} = 10.0 \text{ m/s}.</me>
				Therefore, the distance moved in <m> t = 30.0 </m> sec:
				<me> \Delta x = v_{av} t = 10.0 \text{ m/s} \times 30.0 \text{ s} = 300.0 \text{ m}.</me> 
			</p>
		</solution>
		<solution> <title>b</title>
			<p> 
				To get <m> a </m>, we just use the velocities and time given.
				<me> a = \dfrac{v_f - v_i }{t} = \dfrac{2}{3} \text{ m/s}^2.</me>
				From the description, it is clear that truck's speed is picking up. Hence, the direction of the acceleration is same as the direction in which the truck is moving, which is down the inclined road.

		<statement>
			<p> 
				A cheeta's acceleration varies during its motion over a wide range. An example is given in <xref ref="fig-bc-cheetah-speed-vs-time-1"/> below. Even though, the real-life situation is complicated, we can get a lot of physics by modeling the motion <alert> as if</alert> the motion was a constant acceleration motion, by replacing the varying acceleration by an average acceleration value. You would, of course not get the exact values, but your answer will be in the right ball park.

			<p>
				Suppose, the average acceleration of a cheetah between <m> t=0 </m> and <m> t = 30\text{ sec}</m> is <m> 2.2\text{ m/s}^2</m>. If cheetah started out at rest, what will be (a) the distance traveled and (b)  speed at <m> t = 30\text{ sec}</m>?

		(a) <m> 990\text{ m} </m>, (b) <m> 66\text{ m/s} </m>.  </p> </answer>
		<solution> <title>a</title>
			<p> 
				Since <m> \Delta t</m> and <m> v_i </m> are given to us, the following equation will give the displacement. Dropping <m>x</m> from subscript and writing <m>t</m> for <m>\Delta t</m>.
				<me>
					\Delta x = v_{i} t + \dfrac{1}{2} a_{\text{av}} t^2.
				</me>
				With the numerical values given, we get
				<me>
					\Delta x = 0 + \dfrac{1}{2} \times 2.2\times 30^2 = 990\text{ m}.
				</me>

			</p>
		</solution>
		<solution> <title>b</title>
			<p> 
				The velocity at the final instant can be obtained by
				<me>
					v_{f} = v_{i} +  a_{\text{av}}\,  t  = 2.2\times 30 = 66\text{ m/s}.
