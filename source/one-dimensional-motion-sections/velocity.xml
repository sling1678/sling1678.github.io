			Perhaps the crudest measure of how fast something is moving comes from looking at the distance it has covered in a given time. The ratio of the distance convered,  <m> d </m>, and the time taken, <m> t </m>, is called <term> average speed </term>. We will denote average speed by the symbol <m>v_{\text{s,av}}</m>, and if there is no confusion in the context, then by simply <m>v</m>.
			<men>
				v_{\text{s,av}} = \dfrac{d}{t}.
			</men>
			Suppose you drive a car for a distance of <m> 4000\text{ km} </m> in <m> 50\text{ hr}</m>. Then your average speed will be  
			<me> 
				v_{\text{s,av}} = \dfrac{4000\text{ km}}{50\text{ hr}} = 80\text{ km/hr}. 
			</me>
			Note that when we are speaking about average speed, we are not concerned with the direction changes during the motion or the overall direction of motion. We are also not refering the varying value of speed along the way. We are concerned with just the length of the path driven and the total time taken on that path.

			Another measure of motion has to with the rate of overall movement from the intitial instant to the final instant. Here, we do not care about all the places you visited during the interval, but just where you were at the beginning and where you ended up at the end, i.e., we care about displacement during the interval and not the distance covered. Average velocity is obtained by dividing the displacment by the interval. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If the motion is on the <m> x </m> axis, we will denote the average velocity by the symbol <m> v_{\text{av},x}</m>, which will be the ratio of the displacement, <m> \Delta x </m>, and the time interval, <m> \Delta t </m>.
			<men>
				v_{\text{av},x} = \dfrac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}.
			</men>
			Note that average <m>x</m> velocity has the same sign as the sign of the displacement <m>\Delta x</m> of the motion. We say that the sign of <m>\Delta x</m> and <m>v_{\text{av},x}</m> tell us the <term>direction</term> of the motion in that interval. If sign is positive, the motion is in the same direction as the direction of positive <m>x</m>-axis and if the sign is negative the direction is towards the negative <m>x</m>-axis.

					</me>
					but your displacemnt would be
					<me>
						\Delta x = x_C - x_A =  2\text{ m}.
					</me>
					The difference is due to the fact that tracking back canceled out part of the original displacement and you ended up at <m> x = 2\text{ m}</m> from the starting place A, <m>x = 0</m>. Now, say A-to-B-to-C took <m> 5\text{ sec}</m>, then your average velocity and average speed will be

		<remark><title>Average Speed and Magnitude of Average Velocity</title>
			<p>
				The absolute value of this <m>1.5\text{ m/s}</m> in <xref ref="example-negative-x-velocity"/> is called the magnitude of the <m>x</m>-velocity and the negative sign gives the direction to be the direction of the negative <m>x</m>-axis, i.e., towards <m>x = -\infty </m>. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, compare the magnitude of this average velocity of the average speed between A and C in that example. For average speed, we need the distance travelled over the full path between A and C. That gives us
				<me>
					d_{AC} = d_{AB} + d_{BC} = 2 + 5 = 7\, \text{m}.
				</me>
				Hence
				<me>
					v_{s,av} = \frac{d_{AC} }{\Delta t} = \frac{ 7\text{ m} }{2\text{ s}} = 3.5\text{ m/s}. 
				</me>
				Note that average speed is not equal to the magnitude of average velocity! Why? The main reason is that there was a turn around in the motion A-to-B-to-C; this led to traversing back on the same path, which got cancelled in the calculation of the <m>x</m>-velocity but not in the average speed.

		<remark><title>Average Speed and Magnitude of Average Velocity in Infinitesimal Intervals</title>

			<p>
				Now, notice an amazing fact. If the interval of interest is an infinitesimal interval of time, meaning as small an interval as you like, except zero interval. In such an interval, since there will be no turn around, the magnitude of average speed and average velocity will be same. In this case, we call them instantaneous speed and instantaneous velocity.

				For instance, in the case of mathematically infinitersimal time interval, meaning as small as you like except zero.

		<p>
			For displacement and velocity we need change in position occuring in an interval of time, say between instants <m>t</m> and <m>t+\Delta t</m>. To study change occuring AT INSTANT <m>t</m>, we introduce a concept of <term>infintesimal interval</term> around the instant <m>t</m>. We say that the interval between <m>t</m> and <m>t+\Delta t</m> is an infinitesimal interval if <m>\Delta t</m> is as small as we like except:
			<me>
				\Delta t \ne 0.
			</me>
			The corresponding velocity is called <term>instantaneous velocity</term> and the corresponding speed is <term>instantaneous speed</term>.
		</p>
<!-- 		<p>
			Often we want velocity <em> at a particular instant</em>, called instantaneous velocity, or simply, <term>velocity</term>. This refers to the average velocity between that instant, say <m> t </m>, and an instant very close to <m> t</m>, e.g., a tiny amount of time later than <m> t</m>, which we can indicate by <m> t + \Delta t </m> with <m>\Delta t > 0</m>. Or, alternately, between <m>t</m> and a tiny interval before <m>t</m>, say at <m>t-\Delta t</m> with <m>\Delta t > 0</m>.  Or, if we let <m>\Delta t \ne 0</m> but be positive or negative, then, we can combine both these possibilities by simply <m>t + \Delta t</m>.
		</p>
		<p>
			How close should <m> t </m> and <m> t + \Delta t </m> be? We say that we want them to be as close as possible except zero interval. You might complain that this is not good enough and that the answer is a little vague. You may already be familiar with it from your Calculus class since it is at the heart of the concept of taking the limit.  We call this notion of interval an <term>infintesimal interval</term>. It is one of the most important concepts of physics.
		</p> -->
		<p>
			Denoting instantaneous velocity for a motion along <m> x </m> axis by symbol <m> v_x </m>, we write the definition formally using the notation of taking a limit in Calculus,
			<men xml:id="eq-instantaneous-velocity-1d-limit">
				v_x = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \dfrac{x\left(\text{at } t+\Delta t\right) - x\left(\text{at } t\right)}{\Delta t}.
			</men> 
			This is also denoted by the derivative symbol.
			<men>
				v_x = \dfrac{dx}{dt}.
			</men>
			Although <m>\Delta t</m> in the definition Eq. <xref ref="eq-instantaneous-velocity-1d-limit"/> could be positive or negative, we will think of <m>\Delta t \gt 0</m> in our treatment below. That will make it specific that we are thinking of <m>t+\Delta t</m> to be an instant after <m>t</m>. If you like, you can create your own note for case when <m>\Delta t \lt 0</m>.
		</p>
		<p>
			You may recall from Calculus that derivative of a function equals the slope of the tangent of the graph of function at that point. Thus, if we plot <m>x</m> coordinate of motion versus <m>t</m>, we can compute  <m>v_x</m> from the slope of <m> x </m> versus <m> t</m> plot at the appropriate value of <m>t</m>. We will see examples of that below.
		</p>
		<p>
			Taking <m>\Delta t \gt 0</m>, when an object is moving towards <m> x = +\infty</m>, we will have 
			<m>x\left(\text{at } t+\Delta t\right) \gt x\left(\text{at } t\right)</m>, which will give positive <m>v_x</m>. And, when the object is moving towards <m> x = -\infty</m>, we will have 
			<m>x\left(\text{at } t+\Delta t\right) \lt x\left(\text{at } t\right)</m>, which will give negative <m>v_x</m>.   
		</p>
		<p><idx><h>Speed</h><h>Instantaneous</h></idx>
			The requirement that <m> t+\Delta t </m> be as close to <m> t </m> as possible makes the turn around in motion between <m> t </m> and <m> t+\Delta t </m>  impossible. That means, the <alert>magnitude</alert> of instantaneous velocity, i.e., the value without the sign, will correspond to speed at that instant, i.e., <term>instantaneous speed</term>. We will denote instantaneous speed by symbol <m>v</m> without any subscripts. For motion that is only along <m>x</m>-axis, we will get
			<men>
				v = |v_x|.
			</men>
			Note that while <m>v_x</m> can be positive or negative, <m>v</m> will always be positive.
		</p>
		<p>
			We will find in a later chapter that, a general motion can be thought as <q>motion along <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> coordinates</q> with velocity (components)  <m>v_x</m>, <m>v_y</m>, and <m>v_z</m> along them. The speed is then related to the adding these velocities in quadrature. 
			<men>
				v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}.

		<p>
			Instantaneous velocity <alert>for a motion along one axis </alert> can also be defined graphically in addition to its anlaytic definition using the limit concept of Calculus decribed above.  
			Since, instantaneous velocity at instant <m> t </m> is the rate at which <m> x </m> is changing at <m> t</m>, it is equal to the slope of tangent to the <m>x</m> (plotted along the ordinate) versus <m>t</m> (plotted along the abscissa) plot.

						What about the times when the velocity is changing, e.g., at <m>t=20\text{ sec}</m> in the figure? Derivative does not exist at this point, and hence, we cannot get any value of velocity. But, physical velocity of an object is well-defined at al times. So, what's the problem here? It turns out that figures like these are wrong - in reality, you will get a plot that is smooth at the tip, not pointed as shown. this is just an artifact of this type of drawing which is common in early textbooks.

				<p>
					The motion is not steady between A and B, since the object is slowing down, or or between C and D, where it is speeding up. The plot of <m> x </m> versus <m> t</m> is curved during them, which means there is not one slope. <alert>The slope now refers to the slope of tangent lines</alert>.

			Displacement is change in position during an interval. Suppose a motion is along <m>x</m>-axis with position <m>x</m> at instant <m>t</m> and <m>x+\Delta x </m> at instant <m>t + \Delta t</m>. Then, recall that average velocity for the finite interval <m>t</m> to  <m>t + \Delta t</m> is given by
			<me>
				v_{x,av} = \frac{(x + \Delta x) - x}{ (t + \Delta t) - t} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}.
			</me>
			Then, we can immediately get the displacement <m>\Delta x</m> by multiplying both sides by the interval <m>\Delta t</m>.
			<me>
				\Delta x = v_{x,av}\,\Delta t.
			</me>
			<alert>How about getting the displacement <m>\Delta x</m> from instantaneous velocity</alert> <m>v_x</m> given at each instant between <m>t</m> and  <m>t + \Delta t</m>? Since <m>v_x</m> is derivative of the function <m>x(t)</m>, to get change in <m>x</m>, we will need to integrate <m>v_x</m>, which is itself a function of <m>t</m>. Let us denote <m>t_i</m> for the intitial instant and <m>t_f</m> for the final instant, and <m>x_f-x_i</m> for <m>\Delta x</m>.
			<men>
				v_x = \frac{dx}{dt}\ \ \longleftrightarrow\ \ x_f - x_i = \int_{t_i}^{t_f}\, v_x(t)\,dt.
			</men>
			Now, an integral has a nice graphical interpretation - it is the area "under or over" the curve! This is schematically illustrated in Fig. <xref ref="fig-x-from-vx-vs-t-main-new"/>

<!-- 	<subsection> <title> Displacement from Velocity Graphically </title>

		<p>
			We saw above that we can get velocity along <m>x</m> axis from the slope of tangent to the plot of <m> x </m> versus <m> t </m>, in place of computing derivative of the function <m> x(t) </m>. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, we want to ask the inverse question: how can we get <m>\Delta x</m> if we have a plot of <m>v_x</m> versus <m>t</m>? Fundamental theorem of Calculus already addresses this], i.e., <q>integral is inverse of derivative</q>. So, <m>\Delta x</m> will be obtained by integrating <m>v_x</m>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anayltically, an integral can be thought of as a sum, which is related to <q>area under the curve</q> in a  graph. Here, we will be interested in area  between the <m> v_x </m> plot curve and the <m> v_x = 0 </m> line - if <m>v_x \gt 0</m>, we will get positive area and  if <m>v_x \lt 0</m>, we will get negative area. Calculation of displacement <m>\Delta x</m> from a <m>v_x</m> versus <m>t</m> plot is illustrated in <xref ref="fig-x-from-vx-vs-t-main-new"/>.

				Let us find <m>v_x</m> at arbitrary instant <m>t</m> by taking the derivative of <m>x</m>. In units <m>\text{m/s}</m> we get
				<me>
					v_x = \dfrac{dx}{dt} = -10.0\,\pi \sin(2\pi t).
				</me>
				Evaluating at instants asked give the following values.
