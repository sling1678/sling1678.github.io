			Tracing a motion on a diagram is the most basic way of representing motion. If you have taken a road trip or train journey, you are already familiar with this idea. You do this by marking time at various points along your path. This would be your <term> motion diagram</term>. For instance, <xref ref="fig-boston-to-san-francisco-map"/> shows motion diagram for a road trip from Boston (USA) to San Framcisco (USA), where points on the map are marked every 24 hours.

		<p>
			Often we mark position at regular time intervals so that we can easily understand the motion diagram immediately qualitatively, such as where an object is moving steadily, or where speeding up, or where slowing down. For instance, from motion diagram in <xref ref="fig-motion-diagram-one-dim-non-steady" />, it is immediately obvious that the car is slowing between A and B, moving at a steady pace between B and C, and speeding up betwen C and D.

		<p>
			If you were moving on a straight path, as in <xref ref="fig-motion-diagram-one-dim-non-steady"/>,  you could  view the motion occuring on a Cartesian axis, say the <m> x </m> axis. Your markings would then give <m> x </m> coordinates at various times <m> t </m>.  We can fit (i.e., use interpolation between the data points by smooth curve) these data points to obtain a position as a function of time, namely, <m> x(t) </m>, as shown in  <xref ref="fig-motion-diagram-and-xvst" />. The benefit of thinking in terms of function <m>x(t)</m> is that you can do further analysis of motion. You will see that this function gives us analytic definitions of velocity and acceleration, two important characterizations of motion.

<!-- 		<p>
			Another way to look at motion along <m>x</m> axis is to plot <m>x</m> versus <m>t</m>. <xref ref="fig-motion-diagram-and-xvst" /> shows the <m>x</m> vs <m>t</m> plot corresponding to the motion of <xref ref="fig-motion-diagram-one-dim-non-steady"/>. By connecting the points, or interpolating between the marked points, we obtain a continuous function <m> x(t) </m> from the plot, as shown.

				We use the scale to figure out distances from where the boy is at point marked 1. 
				The plot in <xref ref="fig-ex-boy-running-on-straight-track-solution" /> shows <m> x </m> values  along the ordinate and <m> t </m> values along the abscissa.

		<solution> 
			<p>
				First we mark points on the ordinate axis at equal-time intervals. We choose to mark points separated by <m>10\text{ s}</m> intervals. These points are shown as dots in <m>x</m> vs <m>t</m> plot in <xref ref="fig-ex-motion-diagram-from-x-vs-t-solution" />. Then we draw points on the <m> x </m> axis only to get the motion diagram, where we now label each point as 1, 2, 3, ..., which stand for the instants, with label 2 for 10 sec, label 3 for 20 sec, and so forth.
