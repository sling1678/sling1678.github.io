<section xml:id="oneD-Acceleration"> <title> Acceleration </title><idx>Acceleration</idx>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			Acceleration is an important characteristic of motion. It connects the motion of an object to the influence of environment on the motion. In this first exposure to this topic, we will focus on motion along <m>x</m>-axis only. In a later chapter we will study acceleration in a more general setting. 
		</p>
<!-- 		<p>
			The rate at which <m>x</m>-coordinate of an object changes with time gave us velocity <m> v_x</m>. Now, we study the rate at which <m>v_x</m> changes with time. This will give us <term>acceleration</term> for a motion along <m>x</m>-axis. 
		</p> 
		<p>
			In a later chapter you will learn that the acceleration of an object depends on force you apply on the object. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to understand the concept of acceleration well.    
		</p> -->

		<p>
			Similar to our treatment of velocity, we will define an average acceleration and an instantaneous acceleration. For a motion on the <m> x </m> axis, we will denote instantaneous acceleration by symbol <m> a_x</m> and average acceleration by <m> a_{\text{av},x}</m>. 

		</p>
	</introduction>



	<subsection><title> Average Acceleration</title><idx><h>Acceleration</h><h>Average</h></idx>

		<p>
			The average rate of change of velocity during a finite interval can be obtained by dividing the change in velocity by the interval. Let <m> v_{i,x} </m> be the (instantaneous) velocity at instant <m> t_i</m> and  <m> v_{f,x} </m> be the (instantaneous) velocity at instant <m> t_f</m>, then average acceleration, <m> a_{\text{av},x}</m> during <m> t_i</m> to  <m> t_f</m>, will be
			<men>
				  a_{\text{av},x}  = \dfrac{v_{f,x} - v_{i,x}}{ t_f - t_i}.
			</men>
			You can see that writing all the subscripts can be too tedious. So, if there is no confusion that we are working along one axis and that we are dealing with average acceleration, we can write this definition much more simply by dropping off all the unnecessary subscripts as follows.
			<me>
				a   = \dfrac{v_{f} - v_{i}}{ t_f - t_i}.
			</me>
			However, for the sake of being specific and completeness, in the book I will continue to add all the necessary subscripts, but in your studies, you don't have to bother as long as you are clear about what you are suppressing. 
			By writing <m> \Delta v_x</m> for <m>v_{f,x} - v_{i,x}</m> and <m>\Delta t</m> for <m>t_f - t_i</m>, 
			we often write this as
			<me>
				a_{\text{av},x}  = \dfrac{\Delta v_x}{ \Delta t},
			</me>
			Note that for average aceleration, we do not need to know the details of the motion at any instant other than what happened at just the initial and final instants. For instance, for a motion shown in <xref ref="fig-average_acceleration_example_x_axis"/>, the average acceleration between A and B will be obtained from <m>v_x</m> at those points and time between them. 
		</p>
		<sidebyside widths="50% 50%">

				<p>
					If the acceleration is constant, then this acceleration is same as average acceleration. From the definition of average acceleration we have the change in velocity to be

					Therefore in one second
					<me>
						\Delta v_x = -9.0 \times 1 = -9.0\text{ m/s}.
					</me>
					Adding this to the initial velocity gives
					<me>
						v_x(\text{at }t=1\text{ sec}) = v_{ix} + \Delta v_x = 12 - 9 = 3.0\text{ m/s}.

				<p>
					In 2 sec:
					<me>
						\Delta v_x = -9.0 \times 2 = -18.0\text{ m/s}.

					<me>
						v_x(\text{at }t=2\text{ sec}) = v_{ix} + \Delta v_x = 12 - 18 = -6.0\text{ m/s}.
					</me>
					The negative sign here means the object is not moving in the direction of the negative <m>x</m>-axis.

	<subsection><title> Instantaneous Acceleration</title><idx><h>Acceleration</h><h>Instantaneous</h></idx>


		<p>
			Often we want acceleration <em> at a particular instant</em>, called instantaneous acceleration, or simply, <term>acceleration</term>. 
			<!-- This refers to the average acceleration between that instant, say <m> t </m>, and an instant very close to <m> t</m>, e.g., a tiny amount of time later than <m> t</m>, which we can indicate by <m> t + \Delta t </m>. Or, alternately, between <m>t</m> and a tiny instant before <m>t</m>, say at <m>t-\Delta t</m>. -->
			This is the rate of change of velocity at that instant. Again, here we just look at a one-dimensional motion on the <m>x</m>-axis and defer the more complete treatment to a later chapter.
		</p>

		<!-- <p>
			How close instants <m> t </m> and <m> t + \Delta t </m> be? The answer is as close as possible except right at <m>t</m>. This is the notion of infintesimal interval already discussed in <xref ref="subsection-Instantaneous-Velocity"/> on instantaneous velocity.
		</p> -->
		<p>
			Consider an arbitrary motion on <m>x</m>-axis. Let <m>v_x\left(\text{at } t\right)</m> be the <m>x</m>-velocity at instant <m>t</m> and <m>v_x\left(\text{at } t+\Delta t\right)</m> at instant <m>(t+\Delta t)</m>. Then, <m>x</m>-acceleration <m>a_x</m> AT INSTANT <m>t</m> will be defined by the limiting process of taking the duration <m>\Delta t</m> as close to zero as possible except <m>\Delta t = 0</m>.
			<men xml:id="eq-instantaneous-acceleration-1d-limit">
				a_x = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\dfrac{v_x\left(\text{at } t+\Delta t\right) - v_x\left(\text{at } t\right)}{\Delta t}.
			</men> 
			Of course, we also denote this process by a simler notation of the derivative symbol, <m>dv_x/dt</m>, where we think of <m>v_x</m> as a continuous function of <m>t</m>.
			<men>
				a_x = \dfrac{dv_x}{dt}.
			</men>
			Recall that graphically, the derivative of a function is also slope of tangent at that point. Here, we look at the plot of <m>v_x</m> (on the ordinate) versus <m>t</m> (on the abscissa). Then, <m>a_x</m> can be computed by <alert> the slope of the tangent to the <m> v_x </m> versus <m> t</m></alert> at the instant of interest.  
		</p>

		<remark><title>Positive and Negative <m>a_x</m> do not tell direction of motion</title>

			<p>
				Recall that positive <m>v_x</m> corresponded to the object moving towards <m>x=+\infty</m> and negative <m>v_x</m> corresponded to moving towards <m>-\infty</m>. But, positive and negative <m>a_x</m> do not have such simple interpretations. Positive <m>a_x</m> means the <m>v_x</m> of the motion is becoming more positive with time and negative <m>a_x</m> means <m>v_x</m> of the motion is becoming more negative with time. Let us look at two important cases.
			</p>
		</remark>
		<example><title>Positive <m>a_x</m></title>

					Positive <m>a_x</m> adds positive velocity values to <m>v_x</m>. Thus if an object is initially moving towards positive <m>x</m>-axis, it will speed up and if it was moving towards the negative <m>x</m>-axis, it will slow down. In this later case, if <m>a_x</m> remains the same, the object will eventually turn around and move towards positive <m>x</m>-axis, i.e., <m>v_x</m> eventually becoming positive.

			<me>
				a_{x,av} = \frac{(v_x + \Delta v_x) - v_x}{ (t + \Delta t) - t} = \frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t}.
			</me>
			Then, we can immediately get the change in velocity <m>\Delta v_x</m> by multiplying both sides by the interval <m>\Delta t</m>.
			<me>
				\Delta v_x = a_{x,av}\,\Delta t.
			</me>
			<alert>How about getting the change in velocity <m>\Delta v_x</m> from instantaneous acceleration </alert> <m>a_x</m> given at each instant between <m>t</m> and  <m>t + \Delta t</m>?

			The area under the curve is the area between the graph and <m>a_x=0</m> line. Therefore, from positive <m>a_x</m> we get positive area and for negative <m>a_x</m> we get negative area. Positive <m>a_x</m> leads to positive change in the <m>v_x</m> and a negative <m>a_x</m> to a negative change in <m>v_x</m>. This makes sense; say, starting <m>v_x = 10\text{ m/s}</m> and acceleration is constant, <m>a_x=-3\text{ m/s}^2</m>. Then, change in velocity in <m>2\text{ sec}</m> will be <m>\Delta v_x = -3\times 2 = -6\text{ m/s}</m>. This will give <m>v_x = 4\text{ m/s}</m> after <m>2\text{ sec}</m>.

<!-- 	<subsection> <title> (Calculus) Change in Velocity from Acceleration Analytically </title>
		<p>
			The inverse problem of obtaining change in velocity, <m> \Delta v_x</m>, from a known acceleration, <m> a_x(t) </m>, is a similar problem of going from <m> v_x </m> to <m> \Delta x</m>. Therefore, the math is similar.
		</p>

		<p>
			The inverse of Eq. <xref ref="eq-1d-review-accleration-def"/> gives the change in velocity <m> \Delta v_x = v_{f,x} - v_{i,x}</m> when we integrate acceleration <m> a_x </m>.

			</men>
		</p>
		<p>
			In this equation, if we choose <m>t_f</m> to be  a variable <m>t</m>, then  we will get velocity as a function of <m>t</m>. Writing <m>v_{f,x}</m> as <m>v_x(t)</m> we have
