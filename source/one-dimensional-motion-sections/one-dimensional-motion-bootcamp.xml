		<problem><title>Two Cars Moving Towards Each Other on a Straightline </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Two cars travel on a straight East-West road.  Initially the cars are <m>150\, \text{km}</m> apart.  Both cars travel at a constant speed of <m>60\, \text{km/h}</m> with respect to the ground; Car A heads to the east and B to the west.  (a) Write the average velocity of the two cars using x-axis in the East-Wast direction, taking the direction to the East direction as positive.  (b) Find the displacements of the two cars when each has traveled 50 km. (c) Find the time it takes each car to travel 50 km. (d) Find the time when they are 50 km apart if the time is zero when they were 150 km apart.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<answer>
				<p>
					(a) <m>v_{A} = +60\, \text{km/h}</m>, <m>v_{B} = -60\, \text{km/h}</m>.
					(b) <m>v_{A} = +50\, \text{km/h}</m>, <m>v_{B} = -50\, \text{km/h}</m>.
					(c) <m>50\,\text{s}</m>.
					(d) <m>75\,\text{s}</m>.
				</p>
			</answer>
			<solution><title>a</title>
				<p>
					From the description, A is going East (<m>+x</m>-direction). Therefore,
					<me>
						v_{Ax} = +60\, \text{km/h}.
					</me>
					But, since B is moving West (<m>-x</m>-direction),
					<me>
						v_{Bx} = -60\, \text{km/h}.
					</me>
					You can drop subscript <m>x</m> in these symbols as long as you have clearly stated positive and negative directions.
				</p>

			</solution>

			<solution><title>b</title>
				<p>
					ASince the difference <m>x_f - x_i</m> will be positive for A but negative for B, their displacements will be
					<md>
						<mrow>\amp \Delta x_A = + 50\,\text{km}</mrow>
						<mrow>\amp \Delta x_B = - 50\,\text{km}</mrow>
					</md> 
				</p>

			</solution>
			<solution><title>c</title>
				<p>
					For time, only the average speed matters. Here it is <m>v=60\, \text{km/h}</m> for both. Hence, time will be same for both given by
					<me>
						\Delta t = \frac{50\,\text{km}}{60\, \text{km/h}} = \frac{50\,\text{km}}{1\, \text{km/s}}  = 50\,\text{s}.
					</me>
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution><title>c</title>
				<p>
					For them to be <m>50\,\text{km}</m> apart at the end, each must have moved <m>75\,\text{km}</m> since they were <m>150\,\text{km}</m> apart initially and they are moving towards each other. Hence, time will be
					<me>
						t = \frac{75\,\text{km}}{60\, \text{km/h}} = 75\, \text{s}.
					</me>
				</p>

		<problem><title>Two Runners Running Towards Each Other With Different Speeds</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Two runners A and B start out at two ends of a <m>100\text{-m}</m> straight track, and run at constant speeds.  Runner A has a speed of <m>30\ \text{km/h}</m> and runner B has a speed of <m>20\ \text{km/h}</m>.  Where and when they would meet?
				</p>
			</statement>
			<answer>
				<p>
					<m>60\,\text{ m} from A</m> at <m>7.2\,\text{s}</m>.
				</p>
			</answer>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Let us place A at origin and B at <m>x=100\,\text{m} = 0.100\,\text{km}</m> at <m>t=0</m>. Let they meet at <m>x=d</m> (km) at <m>t=T</m> (h). Clearly, 
					<md>
						<mrow>\amp d = 30 T,</mrow>
						<mrow>\amp 0.100- d = 20 T.</mrow>
					</md>
					We need to solve for <m>d</m> and <m>T</m>. Adding them we get
					<me>
						T = \frac{0.100}{50} = 2\times 10^{-3}\,\text{h}.
					</me>
					Then, 
					<me>
						d = 30 \times 2 \times 10^{-3} = 0.060\,\text{ km} = 60\,\text{ m}.
					</me>
					That is, they will meet <m>60\,\text{ m}</m> from A. Let's also write <m>T</m> in seconds.
					<me>
						T = 2\times 10^{-3} \times 3600 = 7.2\,\text{s}.

		<problem><title> Two Runners in a Race - Relative Motion </title>
			<statement>
				<p> 
					Karl and Justin are in a <m>10\text{-km}</m> race. Karl runs at a constant speed of <m> 12\text{ km/h}</m> and Justin at <m> 11.5\text{ km/h}</m>. You can assume <m> t = 0 </m> at the start and their speeds are their full values at the start.
				</p>
				<p>
					(a) Who will finish the race first?
				</p>
				<p>
					(b) What is the value of time, <m> t </m>, when Karl finishes?
				</p>
				<p>
					(c) What is the value of time, <m> t </m>, when Justin finishes?
				</p>
				<p>
					(d) If Karl finishes first, how far away from the finish is Justin when Karl crosses the finish line, and if Justin finishes first, same question for Karl.
				</p>
				<p>
					(e) How far apart are the two runners after <m> 12\text{ min} </m>?
				</p>
			</statement>

			<hint> <p>  (a) Think who is faster? (b) Use <m> v = d/t</m>. (c) Same as (b). (d) Use <m>d = v t</m> on slower with <m>t</m> the finish time of the faster. (e) Multiply the difference in their speeds by time. </p> </hint>
			
			<answer> <p>  (a) Karl, (b) <m> 50\text{ min}</m>, (c) <m> 52.2\text{ min}</m>, (d) <m> 0.417\text{ km}</m>, (e) <m> 100\text{ m}</m>.</p> </answer>
			
			<solution><title>(a)</title> 
				<p>
					(a) Since Karl's speed is greater, he will finish first.
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution><title>(b)</title> 
				<p>
					(b) Using <m> v = d/t </m> on Karl gives
					<me>
						t = \dfrac{d}{v} = \dfrac{10}{12}\text{ hr} = 50\text{ min}.
					</me>
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution><title>(c)</title> 
				<p>
					(c) Using <m> v = d/t </m> on Justin gives
					<me>
						t = \dfrac{d}{v} = \dfrac{10}{11.5}\text{ hr} = 52.2\text{ min}.
					</me>
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution><title>(d)</title> 
				<p>
					(d) Since Karl finishes at <m> t= 50\text{ min} </m>, Justin will have covered the following distance by then (note: I need to convert <m> 50\text{ min} = 5/6\text{ hr} </m> since the speed is given in per <m> \text{hr}</m> unit.)
					<me>
						d = vt = 11.5\times \dfrac{5}{6} = 9.583\text{ km}.
					</me>
					That means, the remaining distance is
					<me>
						10 - 9.583 = 0.417\text{ km}.
					</me>
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution><title>(e)</title> 
				<p>
					(e) Using <m> d = v t </m> with <m> v</m> being the difference of the two speeds. Also, since the speeds have time in <m> \text{hr}</m>, we need to convert <m> t</m> to <m> \text{hr} </m> as well. 
					<me>
						 d = (12-11.5)\times \dfrac{12}{60} = 0.1\text{ km} = 100\text{ m}.

		<problem><title> (Calculus) Varying Acceleration During Parachute Jump</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A parachuter drops off an air plane with zero vertical speed. Suppose magnitude of acceleration of the parachuter varies linearly in time, from <m> g </m> at <m>t=0</m> to zero at <m> t=\tau </m>. 
				</p>
				<p>
					(a) What is the speed at an arbitrary instant <m> t </m> before the acceleration is zero?
				</p>
				<p>
					(b) What is the speed at the instant <m> \tau </m>? 
				</p>
				<p>

			</statement>
			<hint> <p>  (a) Integrate <m> a_y</m>. (b) Evaluate at <m> t = \tau</m> . (c) Integrate <m> v_y</m>. </p> </hint>
			<answer> <p>  (a) <m>\dfrac{g}{2\tau}\, t^2 - g t </m>, (b) <m>\dfrac{1}{2} g\tau</m>, (c) <m>\dfrac{1}{3}\,g \tau^2</m>. </p> </answer>
			<solution><title>(a)</title> 
				<p>
					(a) We would find velocity by integrating the acceleration, and then get the speed from the absolute value. The magnitude of acceleration drops from <m> g </m> to zero in time <m>\tau</m>. Therefore, we have the following formula for the magnitude of the acceleration at instant <m> t</m>.

					<me>
						a(t) =  
						\begin{cases}
							\dfrac{g}{\tau}\, |\tau - t| \amp t \le \tau\\
							0 \amp t \gt \tau
						\end{cases} 
					</me>
					Let positive <m> y </m> axis be pointed up so that
					<me>
						a_y(t) =  
						\begin{cases}
							\frac{g}{\tau} t - g \amp t \le \tau\\
							0 \amp t \gt \tau
						\end{cases} 
					</me>
					Now, we integrate this from <m> t = 0</m> to <m> t=t</m>. With <m> v_y=0</m> at <m> t = 0</m>.
					<men xml:id="eq-Varying-Acceleration-During-Parachute-Jump-vy">
						v_y(t) - 0 = \int_0^{t} a_y(t)\, dt = -\dfrac{g}{2\tau}\, t^2 - g t.
					</men>
					Therefore, speed at arbitrary instant is
					<me>
						v = |\dfrac{g}{2\tau}\, t^2 - g t|.
					</me>
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution><title>(b)</title>
				<p>
					(b) Speed at instant <m> \tau</m> will be obtained by setting <m> t= \tau</m> in the answer for part (a) and taking the absolute value.
					<me>
						v = \dfrac{1}{2} g\tau.
					</me>
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution><title>(c)</title>
				<p>
					(c) Integrating <m> v_y(t) </m> will give <m>\Delta y</m>.
					<me>
						y(t) - 0 = \int_0^{\tau} v_y(t)\, dt = -\dfrac{g}{6\tau}\, \tau^3 -\dfrac{1}{2}g \tau^2 = -\dfrac{1}{3}\,g \tau^2.
					</me>
					The magnitude of this gives the distance fallen.
					<me>
						h = |y(t)| = \dfrac{1}{3}\,g \tau^2.

		<problem><title> (Calculus) Varying Acceleration and Terminal Speed  </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Consider an object falling vertically. In a coordinate system with the positive <m> y </m> axis pointed down, the acceleration <m> a_y</m> has the following expression. Let <m> y=0</m> at <m> t=0</m>.
					<me>
						a_y = g - \gamma v_y,
					</me> 
					where <m> g </m> is acceleration due to gravity, and <m> \gamma </m> is a constant, called the damping constant.
				</p>
				<p>
					(a) Show that at the instant the acceleration is zero, the speed is
					<me>
						v = \dfrac{g}{\gamma}.
					</me>
					The speed is called the <term> terminal speed</term>. We will denote it by <m> v_T </m>.
				</p>
				<p>
					(b) Prove that velocity at arbitrary instant <m> t </m> is given by
					<me>
						v_y = v_T\left( 1 - e^{-\gamma\, t} \right).
					</me>
				</p>

				<p>
					(c) Prove that the <m> y </m> coordinate at arbitrary instant <m> t </m> is given by
					<me>
						y = v_T\, t - \dfrac{v_T}{\gamma}\left( 1 - e^{-\gamma\, t} \right).
					</me>
				</p>


			</statement>
			<hint> <p>  (a) Set <m> a_y=0</m>. (b) Write <m> a_y = dv_y/dt</m>, then change variable to  <m> k = -\gamma v_y + g </m> and integrate. (c) Integrate <m> v_y</m>. </p> </hint>
			<answer> <p>  Already given in problem statement. </p> </answer>
			<solution><title>(a)</title>
				<p>(a)
					Setting <m> a_y=0</m> and <m> v_y = v_T </m>, we imediately get the answer.
					<me>
						v_T = \dfrac{g}{\gamma}.
					</me>				
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution><title>(b)</title>
				<p>
					(b) We express <m> a_y = dv_y/dt</m> and rearrange to obtain
					<me>
						\dfrac{dv_y}{g - \gamma v_y} = dt.
					</me>
					Integrating this from <m> t=0</m> to <m> t =t</m> with <m>v_y(0)=0</m> and <m>v_y(t)=v_y</m>, we get
					<me>
						\ln\left( \dfrac{| g - \gamma v_y|}{g} \right)   = -\gamma t.
					</me>
					Since <m> g</m> is larger than <m>\gamma v_y </m>, exponentiating and then rearranging gives. 
					<me>
						v_y = \dfrac{g}{\gamma} \left( 1 - e^{-\gamma t}\right),
					</me>
					which is
					<me>
						v_y = v_T\left( 1 - e^{-\gamma\, t} \right).
					</me>					
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution><title>(c)</title>
				<p>
					(c) Integrating <m> v_y</m> gives the desired answer.
					<me>
						\int dy = \int v_y dt.
					</me>
					Use <m> v_y </m> from (b) and carry out the integration.
					<me>
						y = v_T\, t - \dfrac{v_T}{\gamma}\left( 1 - e^{-\gamma\, t} \right).
