    <title>Coupled Vibrations and Waves</title>

    <introduction>
		<p>
			To most people, waves conjure up images of water waves striking a lake shore or an oceanfront.  When you throw a stone in water you can clearly see the circular water waves traveling outward from the point of impact (<xref ref="fig-waves-in-pond"/>).  There are many types of waves in nature, e.g. sound waves, seismic waves, waves on a string, electromagnetic waves, etc., just to a name a few of the commonly encountered ones.  Despite a tremendous variety, all waves share some common characteristics.  Waves involves vibration of either the particles of the medium or some property, and  transport energy  and momentum over space without an actual transport of material.

			There is a close connection between waves and oscillations.  When a sound wave travels through air, the air particles oscillate to and fro about their equilibrium point in the direction of the wave.  The oscillating particles of air are coupled to each other so that oscillation of one layer of particles can lead to the oscillation of the neighboring particles, thereby transferring energy to their neighbors.  This process repeats in the medium as the wave travels through it.  The mechanism does not require the transport of air particles themselves, but just the transfer of energy and momentum of the particles through local oscillations.  The pattern of oscillations make up a wave.  In this chapter we will study common characteristics of all waves using  mainly the mechanical waves  on a taut string as an example.

    		When two or more objects interact via a restoring force, such as a spring force, their motions are linked and vibratory around an equilibrium.  These vibrations are called <term>coupled vibrations</term> to emphasize the coupled nature of the motion of the objects involved.

    		Sound wave is actually a collective vibratory motion of a large number of particles - for instance sound in air travels as air  particles oscillate to and fro about their equilibria in the direction of the wave.  The oscillating particles of air are coupled to each other so that oscillation of one layer of particles can lead to the oscillation of the neighboring layer of particles.  This process repeats in the medium leading to a traveling sound wave in air.</p>
    	<p>  
    		Note that the mechanism of a traveling sound through air does not require any net transport of air particles themselves, but just the transfer of energy and momentum of the particles through coupled local oscillations.  The pattern of oscillations make up a wave.  In this chapter we will study common characteristics of all waves using  mainly the mechanical waves  on a taut string as an example.
