					Find the expressions for (a) position, (b) velocity, and (c) acceleration vectors (i.e., magnitudes and directions) at an arbitraru instant <m>t</m> with respect to the coordinate system given in the figure.
				</p>

<!-- 
				<p>(a)
					Use a coordinate system that has the positve <m> x </m> axis pointed right and the positive <m> y </m> axis pointed up. Let the origin be located at the base of the tire where the tire touches the ground at <m> t = 0</m> and the pebble is at the top.

			<hint> <p> (a) Introduce another coordinate system with origin at the center of the tire at all times and <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> axes parallel to the one given.

			<solution><title>a</title>

				<sidebyside widths="50% 5% 45%">
					<p>  
						Let us introduce a coordinate system as shown in <xref ref="fig-tire-picture-pebble-two-coords"/>. For convenience, I will define <m>\theta</m> that measures angle from negative <m>y</m> axis as shown. 
					</p>
					<p></p>
					<figure xml:id="fig-tire-picture-pebble-two-coords">
						<caption></caption>
						<image source="./images/circular-motion/tire-picture-pebble-two-coords.png" width="70%" />
					</figure>
				</sidebyside>
				<p>
					Let <m>(x,y)</m> and <m>(x',y')</m> be the coordinates of P at this arbitrary instant <m>t</m> with respect to the two coordinate systems. It is immediately clear from the figure that
						<md>
							<mrow>\amp y = y',\ \  x = x' + v_0 t.</mrow>
							<mrow>\amp x' = -R\sin\theta,\ \ y'=-R\cos\theta.</mrow>
						</md>
					Therefore, position <m>\vec r</m> in original coordinate system will be
					<me>
						\vec r = (-R\sin\theta + v_0 t)\; \hat i +  (-R\cos\theta)\; \hat j.
					</me>
					It magnitude is
					<md>
						<mrow> r \amp = \sqrt{ x^2 + y^2 }</mrow>
						<mrow> \amp = \sqrt{(-R\sin\theta + v_0 t)^2 + (-R\cos\theta)^2 }</mrow>
						<mrow> \amp = \sqrt{R^2 - (2Rv_0\sin\theta) t + v_0^2t^2 }.</mrow>
					</md>
					We can indicate direction in space by angle with respect to <m>x</m> axis by using arctangent.
					<me>
						\theta_x = \tan^{-1}(y/x) =\tan^{-1}\left(  \frac{-R\cos\theta}{-R\sin\theta + v_0 t} \right). 
					</me>
				</p>
				
			</solution>
			<solution><title>b</title>
				<p>
					Now, that we know the components of position, we can obtain components of velocity by taking derivatives. Thus,
					<md>
						<mrow> \amp v_x = \frac{dx}{dt} = (-R\cos\theta)\frac{d\theta}{dt} + v_0  </mrow>
						<mrow> \amp v_y = \frac{dy}{dt} = (-R\sin\theta)\frac{d\theta}{dt}  </mrow>
					</md>
					Since the tire is not slipping, the rate at which angle <m>\theta</m> changes is related to the speed with which center of the tire is moving. The tire has rotated by <m>R\Delta\theta</m>, its center has moved <m>v_0\Delta t</m>. Equating them we get
					<me>
						R\Delta\theta = v_0\Delta t.
					</me>
					This gives
					<me>
						\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \frac{v_0}{R}.
					</me>
					Using this, we rewrite the components of velocity as
					<md>
						<mrow> \amp v_x = (1 -\cos\theta)\;v_0  </mrow>
						<mrow> \amp v_y =  (-\sin\theta)v_0.  </mrow>
					</md>
					Therefore, magnitude of velocity, i.e., speed is
					<me>
						v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} = v_0\sqrt{ 2 - 2 \cos\theta} = 2 v_0 \left| \sin(\theta/2) \right|.
					</me>
					Note: this tells us that the speed of pebble when touching the ground is zero (since <m>\theta=0</m>) and when at the very top, it is <m>(2\;v_0)</m> (since <m>\theta=\pi</m>). That is, speed of the pebble in <m>Oxy</m> coordinate system changes as it goes around.					
				</p>
				<p>
					The direction of velocity can again be given with respect to the <m>x</m> axis by using arctangent.
					<me>

						\theta_x = \tan^{-1}(v_y/v_x) = \tan^{-1}\left( \frac{-\sin\theta}{1 -\cos\theta} \right).
					</me>
					You can further simplify this expression by using double angle formulas. Try that. You should be able to express this without arctangent operation.
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution><title>c</title>
				<p>
					Now, that we know the components of velocity, we can obtain components of acceleration by taking derivatives. Thus,
					<md>
						<mrow> \amp a_x = \frac{dv_x}{dt} = (-v_0 \sin\theta)\frac{d\theta}{dt} </mrow>
						<mrow> \amp a_y = \frac{dv_y}{dt} = (-v_0\cos\theta)\frac{d\theta}{dt}  </mrow>
					</md>
					Replacing <m>d\theta/dt</m> by <m>v_0/R</m> as found in (b), we get
					<me>
						a_x = -\frac{v_0^2}{R}\;\sin\theta;\ \ a_y = -\frac{v_0^2}{R}\;\cos\theta.
					</me>
					Therefore, magnitude of acceleration is
					<me>
						a = \sqrt{a_x^2 + a_y^2} = \frac{v_0^2}{R}.
					</me>
					The direction with respect to <m>x</m> axis will again be obtained by using arctangent.
					<me>
						\theta_x = \tan^{-1}(a_y/a_x) = \tan^{-1}(\cot(\theta)).
					</me>
					Of course, we can write <m>cot(\theta)</m> as <m>\tan(\pi/2 - \theta)</m>. Hence
					<me>
						\theta_x = \frac{\pi}{2} -\theta.
					</me>
					This is actually direction towards the moving center of the tire. Take values of <m>\theta=0, \pi/2, \pi, 3\pi/2, 2\pi</m> and draw them on the corresponding <m>Oxy</m> plane. You will see that the direction is always towards the center of the tire as shown in <xref ref="fig-tire-picture-pebble-two-coords-c"/>.
