<div class="para">Every battery has an internal resistance.  As a result voltage measured at the terminals is not equal to the EMF of the battery. While EMF of the battery is determined by the chemical potential of the chemicals involved, the potential difference, i.e., the voltage across terminals, depends on the resistance of the load connected across the terminals as we will show in the solution here.</div> <div class="para">If you want to explore the issue yourself, try finding a formula for the potential drop across the terminals in the following figure, which has   a battery with EMF <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and internal resistance <span class="process-math">\(R_i\)</span> connected to a load of resistance <span class="process-math">\(R_L\text{.}\)</span> Then, explore <span class="process-math">\(V_T\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(R_L\text{.}\)</span> What happens when <span class="process-math">\(R_L \gt\gt R_i\text{?}\)</span>

<div class="para">From the circuit, we see that <span class="process-math">\(R_L\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(R_i\)</span> are in series. We also see that the terminal voltage is just the potential drop across the load <span class="process-math">\(R_L\text{.}\)</span> Therefore,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
V_T =  \phi_b - \phi_c =   I R_L =  \dfrac{R_L}{R_L + R_i}\, V.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Therefore, the voltage across the terminals of a battery depends upon whatever you connect across its terminals. However, if <span class="process-math">\(R_i \lt \lt R_L\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(V_t\)</span> can be approximately independent of the load.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
V_T = \dfrac{R_L}{R_L + R_i}\, V \approx V\text{ if }R_i=0\text { or } R_i \lt\lt R_L.
\end{equation*}

<div class="para">This can be illustrated for a voltaic cell of EMF 1.5 volts and internal resistance <span class="process-math">\(1\ \Omega\text{.}\)</span>   With a <span class="process-math">\(1000\text{-} \Omega\)</span> resistor load, the terminal voltage will be approximately 1.5 volts, but with a <span class="process-math">\(0.5\text{-}\Omega\)</span> load resistor, the voltage across the same terminals will be only 0.5 volt!</div>
