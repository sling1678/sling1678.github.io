<div class="para">You know that current in a metal is carried by negatively charged electrons. In semicondutors, the sign of the current carrier may be positive or negative depending on the semiconductor. Hall effect can be used to find the sign.</div> <div class="para">A rectangular sample of a semiconcting material is placed between the poles of a magnet so that magnetic field is pointed up. When current is passed through the plate in the east direction, the north side of the sample develops a higher potential than the south side.  Decide if the current carrier is positively or negatively charged.</div>

<div class="para">We first draw a picture in which we first assume the current is carried by the positive charge as in (i) and predict the end that will become at higher voltage by using the right-hand rule of magnetic force.</div> <div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="external/./images/magnetism/ex-6-hall-effect.png" class="contained"></div> <div class="para">Fig (i) shows that if the current was due to mobile positive charges to the right, then the bottom part, i.e. South end, will become more positively charged, which will make that end at higher potential compared to the top part.</div> <div class="para">In Fig. (ii), the north side will be at a higher voltage than the south. Hence the carrier charge in the present problem is negatively charged.</div>
