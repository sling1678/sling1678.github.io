<div class="para">In a steam engine, a fixed amount of water is the working substance which goes through a full cycle, from liquid water at a certain temperature and pressure to steam, and then back to the liquid water at the original temperature and pressure.</div> <div class="para">The heat is put in the working substance, which is water here, in the step when liquid water is converted to steam.  In some other parts of the cycle the steam expands and the energy comes out of steam when the steam pushes on the blades of a turbine, and in some other parts, the water has to be pumped and compressed, which requires work also.</div> <div class="para">In a certain steam engine, net work done by the working substance of the engine was <span class="process-math">\(2000\)</span> J per cycle. If the efficiency of the steam engine is <span class="process-math">\(40\%\text{,}\)</span> how much heat must be rejected in the cooling part of the cycle?</div>

<div class="para">The net work <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> by the engine  and the efficiency <span class="process-math">\(\eta\)</span> of the engine are given here and we need to find <span class="process-math">\(Q_C\text{.}\)</span>  From the efficiency <span class="process-math">\(\eta\)</span> and work <span class="process-math">\(W\text{,}\)</span> we can find <span class="process-math">\(Q_H\text{,}\)</span> and then using the energy balance, we will find <span class="process-math">\(Q_C\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
