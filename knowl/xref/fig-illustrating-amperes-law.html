<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">36.45<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>The value of circulation of magnetic field around Amperian loops can be stated immediately if we know the amount of current enclosed by the loop and the direction from the right-hand-rule applied to the direction of the loop; we do not need to know magnetic field or calculate the circulation integral. In this figure, using Ampereâ€™s law we can state that circulation through loop <span class="process-math">\(\text{L}_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\text{L}_2\)</span> are same, both equal to <span class="process-math">\(\mu_0 I\text{,}\)</span> circulation through <span class="process-math">\(\text{L}_3\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(-\mu_0 I\text{,}\)</span> which is negative since current through the loop is in the opposite direction of loop, circulation through  <span class="process-math">\(\text{L}_4\)</span>  is zero since it has oppositely directed current through the loop which add up to zero, and circulation through <span class="process-math">\(\text{L}_5\)</span> is zero since no current passes through the loop.</figcaption></figure><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="Amperes-Law.html#fig-illustrating-amperes-law">in-context</a></span>
