<div class="para">To apply Bernoulli’s equation, we consider two points in the fluid.

<em class="alert">Point 1:</em> Since the area of cross-section at the surface is much larger than the opening, the speed of flow at the surface is  much smaller than the speed at the opening.  Therefore, I will assume that the speed at a point at the top of the tank may be set to zero without incurring significant error.  The pressure at the surface is the atmospheric pressure <span class="process-math">\(p_0\)</span> since it is freely exposed to the atmosphere.</div> <div class="para">
<em class="alert">Point 2:</em> The pressure against which the water comes out at the opening is also the atmospheric pressure <span class="process-math">\(p_0\)</span> and not <span class="process-math">\(p_0+\rho gh\)</span> as would be the case if water was not flowing!  This aspect is somewhat disturbing to people first learning to think in terms of dynamics rather than static situation, especially after memorizing formulas of static fluid in the last chapter. The reason  for the pressure at the exit to be equal to the atmospheric pressure has to do with the fact  that the only the force due to the atmospheric pressure is opposing the flow coming out of the nozzle.</div> <div class="para">One way to figure out the dynamic pressure at the exit is to pretend that you are the fluid at the exit, and ask, “what force will you be pushing against?” When you think in this language, you would not be confused about the dynamic pressure at any point.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We now put the properties at the two points 1 and 2 in the Bernoulli’s equation.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
p_0 + 0+ \rho g h = p_0 + \dfrac{1}{2}\rho v_2^2 + 0.

<div class="para">Therefore, the speed of water at the spigot is</div>

\begin{equation*}
v_2 = \sqrt{2gh}

<div class="para">This formula is also called the <em class="alert">Torricelli’s theorem</em> .  It is interesting to note that the speed of a freely falling particle dropped from a height <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is given by the same formula.</div>
