</h3> <div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">cyclotron</dfn> is a device for accelerating charged particles.  It was one of the earliest particle accelerators and it is still used today as a first stage in a multistage particle accelerator. Cyclotron uses electric field to boost the speed and magnetic field to bend the trajectory of the particle and bring it in a region where there is electric field to act on it again and again.</div> <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;">
<div class="sbspanel top" style="width:50%;"><div class="para">To accomplish this task a cyclotron used two D-shaped hollow metals with open flat side as shown in <a href="Motion-in-Magnetic-Field.html#fig-cyclotron-ds" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-cyclotron-ds.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 35.30">Figure 35.30</a>.  They are connected to an AC source of voltage, <span class="process-math">\(V = V_0 \cos (2 \pi f t)\text{,}\)</span> which creates an oscillating electric field in the gap between the two D’s.  Particle travels with increasing speed in larger and larger radii circles, but the time is same for each half-cycle.</div></div>
