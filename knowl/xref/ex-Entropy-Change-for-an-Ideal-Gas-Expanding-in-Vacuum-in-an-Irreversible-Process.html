<div class="para">Two moles of a monatomic ideal gas at <span class="process-math">\(-50^{\circ}\text{C}\)</span> is in one chamber of a two chamber insulated container where the chambers are equal in volume and are connected by a stopcock.  The other chamber is evacuated to a perfect vacuum.  When the stopcock is opened the gas rushes into the second chamber without any effort.  Since gas does not move any piston or wall no work is done in the process.  Find the entropy change.</div>

<div class="para">Even though no heat enters or exits the system, the entropy change is not necessarily zero.  We cannot use <span class="process-math">\(dQ/T\)</span> of an irreversible process to find the entropy change.  We have to imagine a reversible process between the initial and final state to carry out the calculation of entropy change.</div> <div class="para">Let us make sure we are clear about the initial and final states, A and B. Since no work is done and no heat is exchanged, the internal energy of the gas  does not change.  As internal energy of an ideal gas is only a function of temperature, this means that the temperature of the final state is same as that of the initial state.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\amp  \text{State } A:\ \  T=223\text{K}, \text{ volume } V, \text{ pressure } p_A.\\

<div class="para">By using the ideal gas law, we can show that <span class="process-math">\(p_B = p_A/2\text{.}\)</span>  Now we can imagine some convenient reversible processes for calculation of entropy.  Since temperature of state B is same as that of state A, we can imagine an isothermal reversible process.</div> <div class="para logical">

<em class="alert">Imagined reversible process: Isothermal process between A and B.</em>  As the system is an ideal gas, the internal energy is only a function of temperature, which makes <span class="process-math">\(dU = 0\)</span> on this process.
