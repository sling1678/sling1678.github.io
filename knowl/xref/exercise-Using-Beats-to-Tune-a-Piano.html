</h4>
<div class="para">The beat phenomenon is very sensitive for detecting the deviation of sound from a pitch.  This helps piano tuners as well as members of orchestra to adjust their musical instruments.  When an instrument key and a standard reference for that key do not produce any beats, then the two are said to be in tune.</div> <div class="para">Suppose that a piano key is supposed to be <span class="process-math">\(256\text{ Hz}\text{,}\)</span> but it is out of tune.  When a tuning fork of <span class="process-math">\(256\text{ Hz}\)</span> is sounded at the same time as the key, one hears a beat of <span class="process-math">\(2\text{ Hz}\)</span> at a lower pitch than the pitch of the tuning fork.</div> <div class="para">(a) (i) By how much is the piano key out of tune? (ii) What is the fundamental frequency of the piano string that the key strikes?</div> <div class="para">(b) Should you tighten or loosen the string to tune in the piano key? Why?</div>

<div class="para">(a) (i) and (ii): Using the beat frequency formula we find that the frequency of the piano key is off by the beat frequency <span class="process-math">\(2\text{ Hz}\text{.}\)</span> Since the average frequency heard is lower than <span class="process-math">\(256\text{ Hz}\text{,}\)</span> the piano key is actually producing at a lower frequency than <span class="process-math">\(256\text{ Hz}\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, the fundamental frequency of the string corresponding to the key is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f = f_\text{tuning fork} - f_\text{beat} = 256-2=254\text{ Hz}.
