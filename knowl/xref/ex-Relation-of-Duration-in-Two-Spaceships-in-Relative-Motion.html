<div class="para">A spaceship (A) is moving at speed <span class="process-math">\(\dfrac{c}{2}\)</span> with respect to another spaceship (B).  Observers in A and B use Cartesian coordinates which have the same directions of the axes in space.  With respect to these Cartesian axes, the motion of A is towards the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis.  That is, from the perspective of B, the coordinates of A move towards the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis.  Observers in A and B set zero of their times such that when the origins of of the two coordinates coincide the times there are also zero.  That is the event given by <span class="process-math">\((x,y,z,t)\)</span> is  <span class="process-math">\((0,0,0,0)\)</span> in A as well as in B.  Observer at the origin of B turns on a laser at <span class="process-math">\(t=0\)</span> and turns off at <span class="process-math">\(t=5\text{sec}\)</span> in his time.  What will the time duration between on and off as observed by an observer in A?</div>
