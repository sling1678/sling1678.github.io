<div class="para">Some ideal gas is placed into a container of volume <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> that has a lid that can be opened remotely. The container is then placed into a very large chamber which is evacuatted to a “perfect vacuum”. The lid is then openned to the vacuum which makes the gas expand essentially against vacuum. How much work is done by the gas?</div>
<div class="solutions"><details class="solution solution-like born-hidden-knowl"><summary class="knowl__link"><span class="type">Solution</span><span class="period">.</span></summary><div class="solution solution-like knowl__content"><div class="para">Since gas expands without any opposing force, it does not do any work. If the gas was not an ideal gas, the gas will need to do work against the cohesive intermolecular force. But, there are no intermolecular forces in an ideal gas, therefore, work done would be zero.</div></div></details></div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="First-Law-of-Thermodynamics-file-2.html#example-expansion-into-a-vacuum">in-context</a></span>
