The attraction between molecules is due to permanent and induced dipoles in the molecules which depend on the make-up of the molecules and the distance between molecules.  Lowering the density increases the average distance between molecules which decreases the effect of the attraction between molecules.  Beyond some density the effect becomes immeasurably small.</div>
