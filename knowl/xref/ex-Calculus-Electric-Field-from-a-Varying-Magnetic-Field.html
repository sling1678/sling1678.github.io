<div class="para">Recall that the current in a solenoid produces a uniform magnetic field inside the solenoid of the magnitude <span class="process-math">\(\mu_0 n I\)</span> and zero outside the solenoid.  The direction of the magnetic field depends on the current direction given by the right-hand rule of Biot-Savart’s law: if you look down the axis, then the direction of magnetic field will be towards you if the current loops around in a counter-clockwise direction as given in the problem statement.</div> <div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:0%;margin-right:0%;">
<div class="sbspanel top" style="width:50%;"><div class="para">From the analogy of Ampere’s law and Faraday’s law discussed above, we note that the problem here is analogous to the Ampere’s law problem of finding magnetic field outside a straight wire that carries a uniform volume current density <span class="process-math">\(\vec J\)</span> as shown in the figure.</div></div>

</div></div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Therefore, in the present situation we can claim that the electric field will circulate in circles around the magnetic field just as the magnetic field of a straight wire circulates around the current. Following the Ampere’s law procedure for a straight wire, we choose an “Amperian loop” in the shape of a circle  that passes through the field point P as shown in <a href="Faradays-Law.html#fig-solenoid-varying-current-solution-2" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-solenoid-varying-current-solution-2.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 38.43">Figure 38.43</a>.  Now, we equate the circulation of electric field around the Amperian loop with the “enclosed” rate of change of magnetic flux through the Amperian loop.</div>

\begin{equation*}
\text{Circulation of }\vec E = - \text{ Enclosed rate of change of magnetic flux.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Since the electric field has the same amplitude at all points of the circle the circulation is just a product of the amplitude of the electric field and circumference of the circle of radius <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> which is the distance of field point P from the axis of solenoid.  The enclosed magnetic flux is also easy to calculate here since the magnetic field is zero outside the solenoid.</div>

<div class="para">To include the direction information, we cast the circulation and magnetic flux in terms of components.  The right-hand rule for Faraday’s law shows that, if the direction of the loop for the circulation is taken along <span class="process-math">\(\hat u_{\phi}\text{,}\)</span> then the direction of the area element will be towards the positive <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-axis as shown in <a href="Faradays-Law.html#fig-solenoid-varying-current-solution-2" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-solenoid-varying-current-solution-2.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 38.43">Figure 38.43</a>.

Also, if you place a charge anywhere outside the solenoid, the charge will experience an electric force in the axial direction when the current in the solenoid is changing, but no such force when the current in the solenoid is steady.</div>
</div> <div class="para">The result obtained here implies a rather strange conclusion: the electric field at a point outside of a solenoid with a time-varying current is not zero, although the magnetic field there is zero!
