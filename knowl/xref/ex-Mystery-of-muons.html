<div class="para">Muons are created when cosmic rays made up of protons and other highly energetic particles strike the upper atmosphere approximately 15 km from the surface of Earth. In laboratory experiments it is found that a muon at rest decays into two photons in <span class="process-math">\(\tau = 2.2\:\mu\textrm{s}\text{.}\)</span> Suppose a muon created at the upper atmosphere has a speed of <span class="process-math">\(0.9999 c\text{.}\)</span>  If we use Newtonian mechanics, we will conclude that within a lifetime, the muon will go a distance of <span class="process-math">\(0.9999 c \tau\text{,}\)</span> which would be 660 m. Therefore, we would not expect any muon to make it to the surface of Earth. However, we do observe a considerable fraction of muons make it to the surface of Earth. What is the correct explanation?</div>

<div class="para">This mystery can be understood if we examine the phenomenon of muon decay by special relativity. We consider two frames: the rest frame in which muon is at rest and the laboratory frame in which Earth is at rest. In the lab frame muon is moving towards Earth and in the rest frame Earth is moving towards the muon. The mystery of muon traveling all the way to Earth can be understood from the perspectives of the two frames as follows.</div> <div class="para">
<em class="alert">Perspective of Lab frame:</em> Muon is traveling towards Earth at speed <span class="process-math">\(0.9999\: c\)</span> and lives long enough to travel a distance of 15 km.  In this perspective, the muon lifetime is dilated and lives longer than the lifetime of <span class="process-math">\(2.2\,\mu\text{s}\)</span> in the rest frame.</div> <div class="para">
<em class="alert">Perspective of muon rest frame:</em> Earth is traveling towards muon at speed <span class="process-math">\(0.9999\:c\)</span> and  in <span class="process-math">\(2.2\,\mu\text{s}\)</span> the surface of the Earth to travels through the distance of thickness of the atmosphere.  In this perspective, the thickness of the atmosphere is contracted and is less than <span class="process-math">\(15 \text{ km}\text{,}\)</span> making it possible for the surface of Earth to travel a distance of the thickness of the atmosphere.</div> <div class="para">Now, let us work out the details of the two perspectives.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">
<em class="alert">Lab Frame:</em> The lifetime in the lab frame will be dilated with respect to the time in the rest frame by a factor of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{,}\)</span> which is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1- V^2/c^2} }= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1- 0.9999^2} }=  70.7.

</div>
<div class="para">Therefore, the lifetime in the lab frame will be</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\Delta t_{\textrm{lab}} = \gamma\Delta t_{\textrm{rest}} = 70.7 \times 2.2\:\mu\textrm{s} = 156\:\mu\textrm{s} .
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Now, in this frame the speed of muon is <span class="process-math">\(0.9999c\text{.}\)</span>  Therefore, the muon will travel a distance,</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\Delta x = 0.9999\:c \times \Delta t_{\textrm{lab}} = 46,795\:\textrm{m} &gt; 15\:\textrm{km}.

</div>
<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x &gt; 15\:\textrm{km}\)</span> this muon will make it to the surface of Earth.</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">
<em class="alert">Muon Rest Frame:</em> Let <span class="process-math">\(L_0\)</span> be thickness of atmosphere in the Earth frame. We have been given <span class="process-math">\(L_0 = 15\)</span> km. Now, from the perspective of the muon rest frame the length <span class="process-math">\(L_0\)</span> will be contracted by a factor of <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\text{.}\)</span>  Therefore, the thickness of the atmosphere will be less in the muon rest frame.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
L = \frac{L_0}{\gamma} = \frac{15,000\:\textrm{m}}{70.7} = 212\:\textrm{m}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Now, during the interval of 2.2 <span class="process-math">\(\mu\)</span>s, the surface of Earth will move 660 m, which is more than the thickness of 220 m.  Therefore, from the perspective of the muon rest frame, the muon will make it to the surface of Earth.  Note that the two frames differ in the reason behind the fact that muon will arrive at the surface of Earth, but they agree on the fundamental physical observation that a muon created at 15 km above the surface of Earth and moving towards Earth at speed <span class="process-math">\(0.9999c\)</span> will make it to the surface of Earth.</div>
