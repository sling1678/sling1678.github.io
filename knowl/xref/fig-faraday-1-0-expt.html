The changing magnetic flux through the loop causes an induced current in the loop of wire as detected by the galvanometer. (b) When the magnet is moving away, induced current has the opposite direction, due to decreasing flux through the loop. When there is no relative motion of the magnet and the loop no current is induced. Only during the time there is motion, there is induced current.</figcaption></figure><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="faradays-experiments.html#fig-faraday-1-0-expt">in-context</a></span>
