The conduction electrons of wire 2 then experience a magnetic force as a result of the magnetic field of wire 1.  The electrical response of the atoms of the material of the wire results in an effective force on wire 2 from wire 1.  This effective force is also called magnetic force between two wires.  Since the effective force between the wires can do work while magnetic force on charges cannot do any work, we will call these forces effective forces.</div> <div class="para logical">
