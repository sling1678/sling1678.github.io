For convenience we will assume that the object distance is <span class="process-math">\(p = \infty\text{.}\)</span>The figure (a) shows that when an object is placed at the near point a sharp image appears at the retina.  Figure (b) shows what happens when an object is further away than the near point of the eye.  In the present case the image is formed in front of the retina.  Figure (c) shows that with a concave lens the final image of the same object as in (b) forms at the retina.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><img src="external/./images/optical-instruments/p-3-correcting-near-sightedness.png" class="contained"></div>
