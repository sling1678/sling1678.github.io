(a) When  switch in circuit 1 is closed, current increases from zero to a non-zero value.  During this time of increasing current in loop 1, the galvanometer shows that there is an induced current in loop 2. (b) When switch in circuit 1 is opened, current drops from a non-zero value to zero. During this time of decreasing current in loop 1, galvanometer shows that there is an induced current in loop 2, which is in the opposite direction to the induced current when current in 1 was increasing. Not shown: when current is loop 1 is steady, no induced current occurs in loop 2 regardless of the value of the current in loop 1.</figcaption></figure><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="faradays-experiments.html#fig-faraday-3-0-expt">in-context</a></span>
