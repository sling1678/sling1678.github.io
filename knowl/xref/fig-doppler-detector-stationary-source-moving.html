The source sends out wavefronts spaced equally in time at the rate of <span class="process-math">\(1/f_0\)</span> per wavefront.  But, these waves are centered at different places because they are generated at the instantaneous position of the source which is changing with time.  The distance between the wavefronts in the front would be less than the distance in the back of the wavefront.  The wavefronts travel at the same speed in the medium regardless of the state of motion of the source. This means that the detector behind the source will register longer time periods or lower frequencies and a detector in the front of the source will show higher frequency with respect to the frequency with which the waves were emitted at the source.</figcaption></figure><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="doppler-effect.html#fig-doppler-detector-stationary-source-moving">in-context</a></span>
