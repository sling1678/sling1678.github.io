<div class="para">The hammer is assumed to be in contact for a brief moment.  After that the block oscillates under the influences of the gravity and the spring force.

<div class="para">From equating <span class="process-math">\(E_2\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(E_0\)</span> we find  <span class="process-math">\(A_2 \approx 1\)</span> cm.  Therefore, in our case we cannot ignore the difference.  The numerical values in this problem are not very good.  They do not illuminate the importance of energy conservation and turning points.</div>
