</h4>
<div class="para">Three forces act at three points on a ring such that their directions are in one plane. We will use one of the forces to indicate the directions of the other two. The forces are: <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> N force in some direction in the plane, <span class="process-math">\(60\)</span> N force in a direction that is <span class="process-math">\(135^{\circ}\)</span> counterclockwise from the direction of the 20-N force and <span class="process-math">\(45\)</span> N force that is acting  <span class="process-math">\(30^{\circ}\)</span>  clockwise from the direction of the <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> N force.  By adding these forces graphically find out the fourth force needed to make the net force on the ring zero.</div>

<div class="para">The graph and the steps to construct the graph are displayed in the figure below.
