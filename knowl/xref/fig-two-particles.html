Had we decided to study the motion of the Earth only, then the Earth would be a one-body system and the Moon and the Sun would have been the external bodies to the system.  Had we decided to study the motions of all three bodies shown, then the system would be a three-body system, and since there is nothign external to this system, the system would have been an isolated system.</figcaption></figure><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="momentum-Center-of-Mass-Motion.html#fig-two-particles">in-context</a></span>
