</h3>
<div class="para">Consider a spherical cavity kept at temperature <span class="process-math">\(T_1\)</span> that has a spherical ball which is maintained at temperature <span class="process-math">\(T_2\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(T_1&gt;T_2\)</span> (Fig. \ref{fig:example-radiation-sphere}).  We wish to find the rate at which heat will be transferred from 1 to 2 by radiation mechanism.  Note that the temperature of the ball inside the cavity will rise.</div> <div class="para">Assume that inside the ball there is a mechanism for taking the heat out so that its temperature does not rise.  Similarly, assume that there is a mechanism for continuously supplying energy to the cavity so that its temperature is also kept at <span class="process-math">\(T_1\text{.}\)</span>  Let the surface areas of 1 and 2 be <span class="process-math">\(A_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A_2\)</span> respectively.  Let  <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon_1\)</span> and  <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon_2\)</span> be their emissivities. Also, assume emissivity and absorptivity of the ball are equal.</div> <div class="image-box" style="width: 70%; margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%;"><img src="external/./images/heat-transfer/example-radiation-sphere.png" class="contained"></div>

<div class="para">We can work out the transfer of heat through radiation by looking at the surface that will be absorbing the heat, which in the present case is the ball.  In time <span class="process-math">\(\Delta t\text{,}\)</span> the ball will absorb radiation from the cavity and will also emit some radiation, the difference of which will be the amount of heat transferred.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\text{Energy absorbed - Energy emitted} = A_2\epsilon_2\epsilon_1\sigma T_1^4\Delta t - A_2\epsilon_2\sigma T_2^4\Delta t
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Hence the rate of transfer of heat from 1 to 2 through radiation is given as follows.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\dfrac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = A_2\epsilon_2\sigma\left( \epsilon_1 T_1^4 - T_2^4\right)
