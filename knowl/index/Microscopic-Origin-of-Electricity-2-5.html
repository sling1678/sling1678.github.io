<div class="para"> Some atoms, such as atoms of sodium, readily lose an entire electron and become positively charged <dfn class="terminology">ions</dfn>, while others gain an entire electron, such as atoms of chlorine, and become negatively charged ions. In Chemistry, we designate these ions with the symbol of the element and the amount of charge in units of <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> For instance, a sodium atom that has lost an electron is designated as <span class="process-math">\(\text{Na}^{+}\)</span> and a chlorine atom that has gained an electron is designated as <span class="process-math">\(\text{Cl}^{-}\text{.}\)</span> These ions are found in the common salt.</div>
