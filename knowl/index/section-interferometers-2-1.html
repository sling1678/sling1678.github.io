<div class="para"> Interference of light has been used to build instruments called <dfn class="terminology">interferometers</dfn> that permit us for measuring length, wavelength, and refractive index extremely precisely.  You can classify these instruments into two types:</div>
<ol class="decimal" id="section-interferometers-2-1-3">
<li><div class="para">Two-beam interferometer</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Multiple-beam interfermometer</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">In a two-beam interferometers, e.g. Michelson interferometer and Mach-Zehnder interferometer, a coherent source of light, such as the light from a laser beam, is split into two parts by an optical device such as a partially silvered mirror, which  are brought together for interference after traveling different paths.  In a multiple-beam interferometers, such as the Faby-Perot interferometer, a coherent source of light undergoes multiple partial reflections at the two sides of a medium. At each reflection some wave is transmitted through. All these transmitted waves are then focused together for collective interference.</div>
