<div class="para"> So far in our discussion, there was no motion of detector or source of wave with respect to the medium.  Hence, in all the foregoing studies, we have assumed that the frequency of wave detected is same as that of the source.  However, if either the source or the detector moves with respect to the medium, there will be a difference in the frequency detected at the detector and that produced at the source.  The effect is called the <dfn class="terminology">Doppler effect</dfn>, named after the Austrian physicist Christian Johann Doppler (1803-1853), who in 1842 proposed the effect in his book titled, “Uber das farbige Lict der Dopperlterne,” which means “the colored light of double stars”.</div>
