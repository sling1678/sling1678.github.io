<div class="para"> How would you heat a tank of gas so slowly that at each instant it remains in equilibrium? This is clearly not possible in reality. In order for heat to flow into the gas, you would need environment of the gas to be at a higher temperature than the gas. This would make the gas near wall to be at a slightly higher temperature than the rest of the gas. This means that the gas would not be in thermal equilibrium with itself or with the environment.</div>
