<div class="para"> A network of electrical devices connected together is called a <dfn class="terminology">circuit</dfn>. A conductor used in a circuit that has a significant resistance is also called a <dfn class="terminology">resistor</dfn>.	When a circuit has only resistors and voltage sources, such as batteries, then the circuit is also called a <dfn class="terminology">resistive circuit</dfn>. We will study circuits in which the potential difference between the terminals of the voltage sources does not change with time. These circuits are called <dfn class="terminology">direct-current (DC) circuits</dfn>.</div>
