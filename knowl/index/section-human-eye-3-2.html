<div class="para"> Contrary to the popular belief, most of the bending of light rays in the eye is not done by the eye lens but by the cornea, which is itself a converging lens of focal length approximately <span class="process-math">\(2.3\text{ cm}\text{.}\)</span>  A finer focusing is done by the eye lens, a converging lens of less power than cornea, having a focal length of approximately 6.4 cm.  The ciliary muscles adjust the shape of the eye lens for focusing on the nearby and far objects.  By changing the shape of the eye lens the eye can change the focal length of the lens.  This mechanism of the eye is called the <dfn class="terminology">accomodation</dfn>.  When the ciliary muscles are relaxed the lens is thin and has a longer focal length so that the distant objects are properly focused at the retina.  For a nearby object, the eye needs a smaller focal length lens, which is achieved by contracting the ciliary muscles and thereby thickening the lens.</div>
