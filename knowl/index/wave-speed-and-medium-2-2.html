<div class="para logical">
<div class="para"> The same competition between elastic properties and inertia would occur in every medium through which a mechanical wave passes. For instance, when sound wave moves through air, which is a longitudinal wave, the volume of air would be compressed and rarified. The elasticity associated with change in volume is characterized by the <dfn class="terminology">bulk modulus</dfn> of air. The inertia of the air particles will be represented by the density of air. Representing bulk modulus by <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and density by <span class="process-math">\(\rho\text{,}\)</span> we will expect the speed of sound <span class="process-math">\(v_s\)</span> in air to be</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
v_s = \sqrt{\dfrac{B}{\rho}}.\tag{14.44}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">Numerically speaking, the bulk modulus of air has approximate value of <span class="process-math">\(1.42\times 10^{5}\text{ N/m}^2\)</span> and the density is <span class="process-math">\(1.2\text{ kg/m}^3\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, speed of sound in air will be</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
v_s = \sqrt{\dfrac{1.42\times 10^{5}}{1.2}} = 344\text{ m/s}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">This value will depend on temperature and pressure since both the bulk modulus and the densty will change. But, even so, the value of <span class="process-math">\(344\text{ m/s}\)</span> is quite representative of the speed of sound in air.</div>
