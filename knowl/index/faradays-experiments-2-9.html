<div class="para"> The direction of induced current is more easily seen by an application of <dfn class="terminology">Lenz’s law</dfn>. Lenz’s law says induced current is in such as direction that its magnetic field opposes change in magnetic field through the loop occuring by whatever is changing in that loop’s environment. We will practice Lenz’s law later in the chapter. Here, you should see able to verify the induced current directions in each picture.</div>
