<div class="para">  Suppose we start at an arbitrary point in an electric circuit and move an arbitrary charge <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> on the circuit through various circuit elements, finally arriving at the initial place, thus making a closed loop. Since final place is same as the initial place, net change in energy of the charge will be zero. To go across some elements, you would need to put in energy; in some other place you would have to take away energy from <span class="process-math">\(q\text{,}\)</span> making the net change zero.</div>

\sum_\text{steps across elements} U = 0.

<div class="para">Since potentials across circuit elements are usually different, when you go across an element, the energy of the charge goes up or goes down by <span class="process-math">\(q\Delta\phi\text{,}\)</span> goes up if <span class="process-math">\(\Delta\phi \gt 0\)</span> and goes down if <span class="process-math">\(\Delta\phi \lt 0\text{.}\)</span> These increases and decreases must sum to zero as illustrated in <a href="Kirchhoffs-Rules.html#fig-kirk-loop-rule-1-2" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-kirk-loop-rule-1-2.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 34.53">FigureÂ 34.53</a>.</div>
