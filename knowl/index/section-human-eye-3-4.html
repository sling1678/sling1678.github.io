<div class="para"> To find the sharpest image point for you, hold a sharpened pencil at an arms length and look at its tip with your naked eye.  Now, as you bring the pin closer, you should notice that there is point at which the tip of the pencil appears clearest.   That would be your near point.   For most people the near point is around 25 cm from the eye.  For the best view you want whatever you are looking at to be at the near point.  Similarly, there is a <dfn class="terminology">far point</dfn>, which is the farthest distance an object is clearly visible.</div>
