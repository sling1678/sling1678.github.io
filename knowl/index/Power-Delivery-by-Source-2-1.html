<div class="para"> The practical importance of the resonance phenomenon is seen dramatically in the choice of the frequency of the driving power source in delivering power to the rest of the circuit. The energy at any instant is stored in the capacitor and the inductor, but only the resistor in the circuit dissipates energy. Therefore,  the average energy used by the circuit during an interval will be equal to the product of the instantaneous power into the resistor  and the interval of time. Thus,  the energy deposited in the resistor in an interval of time between <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(t+dt\)</span> will  be given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/xref/fig-RLC-circuit-res-6a.html">
\begin{equation*}
P(t) dt = I(t) V_R(t),
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(I(t)\)</span> is the current through the resistor and <span class="process-math">\(V_R\)</span> is the voltage drop across the resistor.  From Ohm’s law we can replace <span class="process-math">\(V_R\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(I R\)</span> and obtain</div>

\begin{equation*}
P(t) dt = I_0^2 R\cos^2(\omega t+\delta),
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> is the phase of the current relative to the phase of the driving EMF. The energy deposited in the resistor per cycle is obtained by integrating this expression over a period, <span class="process-math">\(T = 2\pi/\omega\text{.}\)</span>

\begin{equation*}
\textrm{Energy(one cyle)}=\int_0^{T}P(t) dt = \frac{1}{2}I_0^2 RT.

</div>
<div class="para">Therefore, the average rate at which the energy is dissipated in the resistor will be <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}I_0R^2\text{.}\)</span>  This is the average power dissipated.</div>

P_{\textrm{ave}} = \frac{\textrm{Energy(one cyle)}}{T} = \frac{1}{2}I_0^2R.\tag{40.45}

<div class="para">Since the peak current <span class="process-math">\(I_0\)</span> is a function of the driving frequency <span class="process-math">\(\omega\text{,}\)</span> the average power delivered would also be a function of the  frequency <span class="process-math">\(\omega\)</span> of the EMF source.  Thus, the average power is maximum at the same frequency at which the peak current is maximum. We saw above that the peak current was maximum when the source EMF was oscillating at the same frequency as the natural frequency of the circuit. <a href="Power-Delivery-by-Source.html#fig-RLC-circuit-res-6a" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-RLC-circuit-res-6a.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 40.45">Figure 40.45</a> shows the resonance curve of average power.</div>
