<div class="para"> Imagine an electromagnetic wave incident on a material.  The electrons of the surface molecules are accelerated by the electric field in the wave. In addition they also experience a force from the magnetic field.  Consequently, there would be a net force on the surface normal to  the direction of the wave. This would result in a pressure on the material. We call the pressure by electromagnetic wave the <dfn class="terminology">radiation pressure</dfn>, <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span>  Maxwell showed that the radiation pressure <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is equal to the energy density <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> of the wave.</div>
