<div class="para"> You have studied forces between bodies. They can be broadly classified as “action-at-a-distance” forces, such as gravity, electric and magnetic, and “contact” forces. Contact forces, such as normal and frictional forces, either between two bodies or between one part of a body to another, act through a common area of contact.</div>
