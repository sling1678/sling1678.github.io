<div class="para"> In scientific work,  another temperature scale, called the Absolute or <dfn class="terminology">kelvin scale</dfn> is often used, especially in low-temperature physics or cryogenics. This scale has a strong theoretical basis with claims that zero temperature in this scale may never be breached. A reading in kelvin scale to be denoted in this book  by the capital letter <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> is related to the Celsius scale reading <span class="process-math">\(\text{C}\)</span> for the same condition as follows.</div>

<div class="para"> Since 1954, the temperature scale has been fixed by first assigning a temperature of 273.16 degrees to the triple point of water in the Absolute or kelvin (K) temperature scale.  The triple point is defined as the state when all three phases of water, namely ice, liquid water and vapor are in equilibrium at atmospheric pressure, i.e., a mixture of iced water with vapor above it. We assign it a value of <span class="process-math">\(273.16K\text{.}\)</span>
