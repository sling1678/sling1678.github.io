<div class="para">As you have known from your study of dynamic fields that voltage concept is not applicable when you have changing magnetic field, which you have in the transformer. To compare the “voltage” across the two coils in a transformer, we will make the assumption that there is no changing magnetic field outside the generator and the coils.  As we have seen before, this assumption allows us to consider the electric field outside the generator and the coils a conservative field which can be   used to define the potential difference across the primary and the secondary coils.  Let the voltages across the primary and secondary be denoted by <span class="process-math">\(V_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(V_2\)</span> as shown in <a href="Coupled-Circuits.html#fig-ac-transformer-2" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-ac-transformer-2.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 41.55">Figure 41.55</a>.  The power dissipated in the secondary must equal the power produced in the primary.  This gives</div>
