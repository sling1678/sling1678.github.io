<div class="para"> The other product of interest to us is the  vector product, which is often called the cross product. Unlike the result of the scalar product, the result of a vector product is another vector, whose magnitude depends upon magnitudes of the two vectors and the angle between them, and whose direction  depends on the orientations of the two vectors being multiplied. So, to define the vector product, we need rules for the magnitude as well as the direction for the product.</div>
