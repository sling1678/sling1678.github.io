<div class="para"> This induced EMF is called <dfn class="terminology">rotational EMF</dfn> and will induce current in the  wires.  In order for the current to come out of the rotating loop, the loop cannot be a closed wire but an open wire with which contacts have to be made from outside wires thus completing the loop for the current flow as shown in the diagram in <a href="Motional-EMF-from-Rotation.html#fig-AC-generator" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-AC-generator.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 38.33">FigureÂ 38.33</a>.  The open loops are mounted on a drum, called the  <dfn class="terminology">armature</dfn>,  which rotates about an axle.  Slip rings are mounted on the axle to which outside wires make contact with the rotating open loops.</div>
