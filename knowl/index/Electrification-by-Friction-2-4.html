<div class="para"> Ancient Greeks knew of this property, as recorded by Thales of Miletus (circa. 635 BC - 543 BC), when it was found that an amber rubbed with silk attracted light objects.  A serious study of these effects began with <dfn class="terminology">William Gilbert</dfn> of England (1544AD – 1603AD), who is regarded as the “father of the science of electricity and magnetism”. Gilbert coined the word <dfn class="terminology">electrification</dfn>, after the Greek word <span class="process-math">\(\eta\lambda\epsilon\kappa\tau\rho o\nu\)</span> (elektron), meaning amber.  A rubbed body, which attracts light objects, is said to be electrified, or electrically charged.</div>
