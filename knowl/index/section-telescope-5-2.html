<div class="para"> An important use of a telescope is to be able to resolve images of two nearby stars. The image seen through a telescope is affected by a number of factors, such as poor optics and blurring by atmosphere. When a telescope, such as Hubble, is placed above the atmosphere and optical aberrations discussed below are eliminated, resolving two point-like objects is still limited by <dfn class="terminology">diffraction effects</dfn>, which cannot be eliminated since it is fundamental aspect of wave nature of light.</div>
