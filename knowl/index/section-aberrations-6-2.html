<div class="para"> In our discussion of astigmatism above, we stated that for a spherical lens primary and secondary images of a planar object forms on curved surfaces.  When the primary and secondary surfaces coincide, it removes blurring of the image since all rays from a planar object now focus on the same image, and we say the image does not have astigmatism.  But, even though the image is sharp, the trouble is that the image of a planar object is not planar; instead it is a curved surface.  If you make a screen that matches with this curved surface, you will get a sharp image of the object, while if you try to display the image on a planar surface such as a photographic film, parts of the image will be in focus wherever the screen coincides with the Petzval surface while at other places the image will be out of focus. The effect is called curvature of field aberration. Curvature of field aberration is a big problem in slide and movie projectors where one has a flat object projected on a flat screen. Usually a combination of convex and concave lenses is employed to flatten the field and minimize the curvature.</div>
