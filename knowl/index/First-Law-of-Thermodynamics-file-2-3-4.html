<div class="para"> Suppose the gas is initially at temperature <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> and in thermal equilibrium with a water bath also at temperature <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> When you heat water bath, its temperature will increase. You will find that energy begins to flow into the gas raising its temperature as well. But since the volume of the gas did not change, the energy change of the gas is not by a mechanical work, but by some other mechanism - a mechanism that requires a difference in temperarture across a thermally conductive material. This mechanism of energy transfer is what we have called <dfn class="terminology">heat transfer</dfn>.</div>
