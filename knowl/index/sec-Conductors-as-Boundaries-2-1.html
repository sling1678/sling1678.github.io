<div class="para"> We have stated above that electric field inside a conductor is zero in the case of electrostatic conditions, and consequently a conductor has the same potential throughout its body, including its surface.  Hence, the surface of a conductor is a constant potential surface. Therefore, a conductor having a particular amount of excess charge will be at a definite potential with respect to zero at infinity.</div>
