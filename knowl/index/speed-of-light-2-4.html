<div class="para"> Perhaps the first attempt at measuring the speed of light was made by Galileo Galilei of Italy in early 1600s.  Galileo and an assistant each carried a lantern with a shutter and placed themselves on different hilltops about a mile apart.  As Galileo opened the shutter, his assistant was to open his shutter as soon as he saw the light from Galileoâ€™s lantern.  Galileo will then record the time for the round trip.  He found no difference in the result from the result on the same experiment conducted with the lanterns only a few meters apart.</div>
