<div class="para"> Temperature is actually a property associated with the state of <dfn class="terminology">thermal equilibrium</dfn>. Suppose you place a wooden block, initially at room temperature, into an oven whose temperature is set at <span class="process-math">\(300^{\circ}\text{F}\text{.}\)</span> After some time has passed, you will notice that the wooden blockâ€™s temperature is also <span class="process-math">\(300^{\circ}\text{F}\text{.}\)</span> We say that the system (the block) has reached in thermal equilibrium with the environment (the oven) due to the fact that wooden block was not insulated from the oven, but could exchange heat with it.</div>
