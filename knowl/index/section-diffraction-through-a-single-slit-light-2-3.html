<div class="para"> We place a screen behind the slit to observe the diffraction pattern there when it is placed at different distances from the slit.  If the screen is placed immediately behind the slit, we find a <em class="alert">shadow of the slit</em> on the screen.  When we move the screen further out, the shadow develops fringes whose pattern changes as you move the screen further out.  These patterns are called <dfn class="terminology">Fresnel or near-field diffraction</dfn>. Moving the screen further away from the slit you reach a region where the patterns stabilize and although they spread out more as you move the screen further away, the pattern remains the same.  We call this pattern the <dfn class="terminology">Fraunhofer or far-field diffraction</dfn> after <dfn class="terminology">Joseph von Fraunhofer</dfn>, who built the first diffraction grating consisting of 260 closely, spaced parallel wires in 1821, and measured wavelengths of colored lights.</div>
