<div class="para">There are many systems of interest in which the mass of the system is not constant in time. For instance, a rocket loses fuel when it is in the accelerating phase, a squid propels itself forward by ejecting water from back, etc. Although, in the case of rocket, for instance, the total mass of the rocket and the ejected fuel does not change, we are normally interested in describing the motion of the rocket only, which does lose the fuel and hence its mass changes with time. Similarly, when rain drops fall, they gather more water molecules thus increasing their mass with time.  These systems are called syterms with <dfn class="terminology">time-varying mass</dfn>  or <dfn class="terminology">open systems</dfn>. </div>
