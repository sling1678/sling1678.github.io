<div class="para"> Turning on the vibrator, shown on the left end of the figure by a triangle, sends a wave towards the knot.  We call this wave the <dfn class="terminology">incident wave</dfn>. When the wave arrives at the knot, the knot is vibrated by the incoming wave.  As a result the knot acts as a wave transmitter sending waves in the two directions, one in the second string, the <dfn class="terminology">transmitted wave</dfn> and the other in the first string,   the <dfn class="terminology">reflected wave</dfn>  which moves in the opposite direction to the wave coming from the vibrator.  The reflected wave will come back and strike the vibrator. We will assume that strings are very long and we are looking at times when reflected wave has not struck the vibrator yet. Similarly, we assume that transmitted wave has not struck the other end.</div>
