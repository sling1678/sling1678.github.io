<div class="para">In order to create a uniform system of units, Government of France, in 1792, adopted a new system of weights and measures. They chose <dfn class="terminology">meter</dfn> as the fundamental unit of length.  The name meter comes from the Latin word metrum and the Greek word metron, both meaning “measure”.  One meter was defined to be <span class="process-math">\(10^{-7}\)</span> times or one ten-millionth of the distance on the meridian from the North Pole to the equator passing through Paris.  The factor was chosen to get a size close to the “human scale”.  Later it was found that prototypes based on earth-based definition were about 0.2 mm too short due to the flattening of earth from its rotational motion.</div>
