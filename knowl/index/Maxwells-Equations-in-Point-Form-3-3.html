<div class="para"> You may recall that we had introduced the concept of fields to get away from the action at a distance present in the non-field formulation, such as  the Coulomb’s force law and Newton’s law of universal gravitation.  We also found that experimental observations are usually interpreted in terms of laws that integrate over these fields. With the correction by Maxwell to Ampere’s Law  we have following four laws of electric and magnetic field in the <em class="alert">integral form</em>.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align}
\amp \textrm{Gauss's Law for }\vec E:
\ \ \oint \vec E\cdot d\vec A = \frac {Q_{\textrm{enc}}}
{\epsilon_0}  \tag{42.6}\\
\amp \textrm{Gauss's Law for }\vec B:\ \ \oint \vec B\cdot d\vec A =0 \tag{42.7}\\
\amp \textrm{Faraday's Law:}\ \ \oint \vec E\cdot d\vec l = -\frac {d \Phi_B}{d t} \tag{42.8}\\
\amp \textrm{Ampere-Maxwell's Law:}\ \ \oint \vec B\cdot d\vec l =\mu_0 I_{\textrm{enc}} +\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac {d \Phi_E}{d t} \tag{42.9}
\end{align}
</div>
<div class="para">The integral forms are written in terms of the flux   and circulations of the electric and magnetic fields. We have also learned  that the flux and circulations of vector fields are related to their divergence and curl. More specifically, flux per unit volume through a closed surface  is equal to the divergence of the field, and circulation per unit area of a loop is equal to the component of the curl of the vector field in the direction perpendicular to the loop. We can use these results from multivariate calculus to deduce equations that applicable at each point in space and at a particular instant in time, i.e., localized or point-form.</div>
