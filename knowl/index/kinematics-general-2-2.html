<div class="para">If we assume that the three-dimensional space we inhabit consist of geometrical points, then each point of space will have unique values for Cartesian coordinates (<span class="process-math">\(x,y,z\)</span>) in a particular frame. The coordinates of the geometrical points in space can be used to indicate the location of an object if the object occupies only one space point at a time. Fundamental particles are assumed to be point-like in this sense, and we refer to them as <dfn class="terminology">point particles</dfn>.  However, we would also like to study extended objects such as boxes, people, cars, planets, stars and galaxies, which occupy some volume of space containing infinitely many points of space.</div>
