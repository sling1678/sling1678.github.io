<div class="para"> To get a feel for the concept, consider moving a charge <span class="process-math">\(+Q\)</span> near another charge <span class="process-math">\(+q\text{,}\)</span> which remains fixed in its place, as shown in <a href="Electric-Potential-Section.html#fig-work-in-moving-a-charge" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-work-in-moving-a-charge.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 31.1">FigureÂ 31.1</a>. Suppose you move <span class="process-math">\(+Q\)</span> so that your force on <span class="process-math">\(+Q\)</span> is only an infinitesimally greater than needed to balance the electric force on <span class="process-math">\(+Q\text{;}\)</span> that is, we maintain net force on <span class="process-math">\(+Q\)</span> zero and hence its speed will not change. Then, by conservation of energy, work done by you will go towards changing the potential energy of <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span> Since, we worked against electric force only, this potential energy is called <dfn class="terminology">electric potential energy</dfn> (EPE).</div>
