<div class="para"> Often, the work done by the nonconservative forces is too complicated to compute, but the accounting-of-energy approach illustrated in <a href="energy-Energy-Flow.html#fig-energy-flow-diagrams" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-energy-flow-diagrams.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 8.63">FigureÂ 8.63</a> is more amenable to calculation. This approach is based on observation that work by non-conservative forces, <span class="process-math">\(W_{if}^{\text{non-cons}}\text{,}\)</span> may come from forces within the system (such as viscosity in voscous flow of a fluid or burining of fuel inside the engine or hear flow) and/or from external agents (such as a push or pull or heat flow) - some of these works will be positive and some others will be negative. The positive work will put energy in and the negative work will take energy out of the system.</div>
