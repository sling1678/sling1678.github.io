<div class="para"> Rumford also calculated the amount of heat produced in the boring of a cannon and related it to the mechanical energy put in for boring thereby finding the first reported value of the <dfn class="terminology">mechanical equivalent of heat</dfn>.  His value expressed in the unit of heat (calories) and the British unit of mechanical energy (Foot-pound) would be <span class="process-math">\(3.15 \)</span> foot-pound per calorie, which is approximately <span class="process-math">\(1.5\%\)</span> higher than the presently accepted value.  Count Rumford also invented many other useful devices, such as the kitchen range, the double boiler, the pressure-cooker and the drip coffee maker.</div>
