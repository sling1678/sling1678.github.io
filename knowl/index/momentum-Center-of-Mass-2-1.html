<div class="para"> A macroscopic object such as a car or a human being has many independently moving parts. They are examples of <em class="alert">multiparticle systems</em>. To understand their motion fully you need to study motion of each part and how they impact each other. However, all you need is the overall motion of the entire body, regardless of the changing shape due to independenly moving parts, you can follow the motion of the entire mass placed at a special mathemtical point for the entire body.</div>
