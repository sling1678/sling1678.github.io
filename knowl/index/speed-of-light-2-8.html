<div class="para"> Of course if the distance for the travel of light in Galileo’s experiment were large, then we may be able to determine the speed of light by his method.  Astronomical objects do provide large distances and could be used to deduce speed of light if we know the distance by some other means.  In 1675 the Danish astronomer Ole Römer noticed something strange in the motion of the largest and brightest moon Io about planet Jupiter. The basic observations of Römer are illustrated in <a href="speed-of-light.html#fig-romer-speed" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-romer-speed.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 43.5">Figure 43.5</a>.   From his observations of the moon Io he deduced that the time required for the light to travel a distance equal to the diameter of the orbit of the Earth about the Sun is equal to 16 minutes and 36 seconds.</div>
