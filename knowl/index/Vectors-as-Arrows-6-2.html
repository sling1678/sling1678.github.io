<div class="para"> Evidently dividing a vector <span class="process-math">\(\vec A\)</span> by its magnitude <span class="process-math">\(|\vec A|\)</span> one should obtain a vector whose length is <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> with no units and the same direction as the direction of vector <span class="process-math">\(\vec A\text{.}\)</span>  This vector is called <dfn class="terminology">unit vector</dfn> in the direction of <span class="process-math">\(\vec A\text{.}\)</span>  We will denote unit vectors obtained this way by placing a karat over the symbol of the original vector, <span class="process-math">\(\hat A\text{.}\)</span>  Thus, unit vector <span class="process-math">\(\hat A\)</span> is</div>

<div class="para">Unit vectors are very useful for constructing vectors of arbitrary lengths. For instance, if we want a displacement vector of length <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> cm in the direction of some unit vector <span class="process-math">\(\hat u\text{,}\)</span> then all we need to do is to multiply <span class="process-math">\(\hat u\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(5\ cm\text{,}\)</span> giving the desired vector <span class="process-math">\((5\ \text{cm})\hat u\text{.}\)</span> Now, a force vector of length <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> N in the same direction as <span class="process-math">\(\hat u\)</span> will be <span class="process-math">\((10\ \text{N})\hat u\text{.}\)</span> You can see that unit vectors have universal applicability regardless of how you construct them.  They are holders of the information about directions in space. As you might have guessed it, there are infinite number of unit vectors, one for each direction in space.</div>
