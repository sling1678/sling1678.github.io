<div class="para"> By analyzing the vibration of the particles of the medium, we can show that the speed of mechanical waves, including sound wave, through a medium comes from a competition between two opposite tendencies - a restoring force whose tendency is to bring the particle to equilibrium and an inertia whose tendency is to maintain the motion.  In a one-dimensional system such as a string, the restoring force is provided by the tension in the string <span class="process-math">\((F_T)\)</span> and the inertia is provided by mass per unit length of the string <span class="process-math">\((\mu )\text{.}\)</span>  The speed of mechanical wave in a string was stated in the last chapter to be</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
v =\sqrt{\frac{F_T}{\mu}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para"> The speed of sound in air is similarly related to the properties of air.  The restoring force is provided by the bulk modulus <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and the inertia is provided by mass per unit volume  <span class="process-math">\(\rho\text{.}\)</span>  The speed of sound in air is therefore given in terms of properties of air by the following.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The density of air is not constant. It depends on the temperature and pressure.  We quote here experimental relation of dependence of speed on temperature.  At 1 atm and <span class="process-math">\(0^{\circ}\text{C}\text{,}\)</span> the speed of sound in air is found to be 331 m/s and at another temperature <span class="process-math">\(t^{\circ}\text{C}\text{,}\)</span> the speed of sound in air at 1 atm is given by the following approximate formula.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
v\approx 331\left(1+1.8\times 10^{-3}t\right)\text{ m/s}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Thus at room temperature of <span class="process-math">\(20^{\circ}\text{C}\text{,}\)</span> the speed of sound in air is approximately <span class="process-math">\(343\text{ m/s}\text{.}\)</span>
