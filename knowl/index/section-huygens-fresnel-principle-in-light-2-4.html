<div class="para"> Augustin Jean Fresnel used the ideas of interference to modify Huygensâ€™ principle so that one can understand the diffraction phenomena better.  Fresnel hypothesized that every point of a primary wave could be thought of as producing secondary wavelet.  But rather than their envelop, it was their overlap and interference that formed the primary wavefront later. The modified version is called the <dfn class="terminology">Huygens-Fresnel principle</dfn>.</div>
