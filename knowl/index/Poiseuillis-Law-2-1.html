<div class="para"> The French physician Jean Poiseuille studies the flow of fluids through uniform pipes experimentally and publised his results in 1840’s. The results were theoretically derived by George Stokes in 1845 which made the conditions under which the law is applicable. We will present the derivation in the Calculus subsection below. We list here the conditions for the applicability of Poiseuilli’s Law before we state the law.</div>
