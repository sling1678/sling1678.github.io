<div class="para"> The first step in the analysis of an AC circuit is to replace circuit elements by their impedances.  Each resistor <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is replaced by its <span class="process-math">\(Z_R = R\text{,}\)</span> each inductance <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is replaced by its impedance <span class="process-math">\(Z_L = i\omega L\text{,}\)</span> and each capacitance is replaced by its impedance <span class="process-math">\(Z_C =1/ i\omega C\text{.}\)</span>   Then, we subject the circuit by Kirchoff’s current law for complexe currents and Faraday’s loop rule for each loop in the circuit. We then, solve for complex currents and deduce the physical currents from the real parts of the complex currents. These steps are best illustrated by examples.</div>
