<div class="para"> Even a small amount of charge corresponds to a large number of electrons.  For instance, a nano Coulomb of charge, which is not much as far as charges go, would contain about <span class="process-math">\(10^{10}\)</span> electrons. Therefore, rather than treat such large collection of charges individually, we model them as distributed continuously with a <dfn class="terminology">charge density</dfn> or volume charge density, i.e., charge per unit volume, which we will denote by the Greek symbol <span class="process-math">\(\rho\text{,}\)</span> pronunced as “rho”.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\rho = \dfrac{q}{V}.\tag{29.19}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">This is similar to mass density you are familiar with, but with one diffrence - charge density can be positive and negative, depending on the type of charge <span class="process-math">\(q\text{.}\)</span> Thus, if you remove some electrons from a neutral body, the charge density of the body will be positive, and if you place extra electron on a neutral body, the body will have negative charge density.</div>
