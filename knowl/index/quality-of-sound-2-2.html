<div class="para"> Musical instruments produce discrete set of frequencies, the fundamental and overtones, whose frequencies are integral multiples of the fundamental frequency.  When a particular key is played on an instrument, it generally produces both the fundamental frequency and the overtones.  You may have noticed that the same key, for instance the middle C of piano, played on different instruments, sound different to our ears.  The physical reason for the difference is the different mixture of overtones and their relative amplitudes produced in each.  Different mixtures of overtones give the sound its <dfn class="terminology">quality</dfn>. In case of musical instruments this referreed to as <dfn class="terminology">tone color or timber</dfn>.</div>
