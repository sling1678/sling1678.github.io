<div class="para"> An important point about the driven circuit in the steady state is that its dynamical quantities such as voltage across the capacitor, current in the circuit, and power delivered to the resistor depend upon the driving frequency, which we can control in the experiment. When you vary the driving frequency, amplitudes as well as phases of oscillations of these quantities can be varied by wide margins. In each case, there is a special frequency at which the amplitude is the largest. This phenomenon is called <dfn class="terminology">resonance</dfn> and the frequency at which the amplitude is the largest is called the <dfn class="terminology">resonance frequency</dfn> of that quantity.</div>
