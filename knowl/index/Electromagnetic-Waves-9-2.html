<div class="para"> Traveling waves transport energy without actually moving particles. Therefore, you can think of an electromagnetic wave in terms of the flow of the electromagnetic energy.  Consider the electromagnetic plane wave solution for electric and magnetic field waves in vacuum we found above.  For a wave traveling in the direction of the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis with the phase constant <span class="process-math">\(\phi=0\)</span> we had the following for the <span class="process-math">\(E_y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B_z\)</span> waves.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\amp  E_y(x,t)  = E_0\cos\left[ k(x - ct)  \right]\\
\amp  B_z(x,t)  = \frac{E_0}{c}\cos\left[ k(x - ct)  \right] 
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">The other components of the electric and magnetic fields are zero in this solution.  The energy per unit volume, or energy density (<span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>), contained in these waves can be calculated by summing the energy in the electric and magnetic fields.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align}
u(x,t) \amp = u_E + u_B = \frac{1}{2}\epsilon_0\vec E\cdot\vec E +  \frac{1}{2\mu_0}\vec B\cdot\vec B.\notag\\
\amp = \epsilon_0 E_0^2\cos^2\left[ k(x - ct)  \right] \tag{42.26}
\end{align}
</div>
<div class="para">Thus, the energy density moves along with the electric and magnetic waves in a similar manner as the waves themselves except that the wavelength is now half as much and the frequency twice as much because of the square of the cosine, which can be converted to a cosine by the double-angle trig formula.  One might say that you also have a wave of electromagnetic energy density.</div>
