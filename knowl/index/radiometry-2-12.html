<div class="para"> Most sources of light do not emit light equally in all directions;  instead they emit more light in some directions than others.  The quantity that gives both a measure of the intensity of light and its direction in space with respect to the source is called the <dfn class="terminology">radiance</dfn>.  The radiance is defined as the power per unit solid angle per unit normal area.  It is usually denoted by the letter <span class="process-math">\(L\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
L = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta \Omega\Delta A}\ \ \ \text{(Radiance)}\tag{43.11}
\end{equation}

<div class="para">Light emitted by a source usually does not have the same power over different wavelength ranges.  For instance, the sun emits more power in the blue-green color, of wavelength approx. 500 nm,  than either blue or red.  To study wavelength-dependence of intensity, one defines “density” of each quantity per unit wavelength.  For instance, we define intensity of light in the range <span class="process-math">\(\lambda\)</span>  to  <span class="process-math">\(\lambda + d\lambda\)</span>  by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
dI = I_{\lambda} d\lambda\tag{43.12}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(I_\lambda\)</span> is the intensity per unit wavelength and <span class="process-math">\(dI\)</span>  is the intensity in the aforementioned range of wavelength.  The total intensity is then obtained by integrating over wavelength. The quantity <span class="process-math">\(I_\lambda\)</span> is important in spectroscopy where we study the distribution of light energy among different wavelengths or frequencies.</div>
