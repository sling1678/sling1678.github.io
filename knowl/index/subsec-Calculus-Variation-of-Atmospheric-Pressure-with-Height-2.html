<div class="para"> If the density of air didnâ€™t vary with height, the pressure will vary with height in a linear way. This can be seen as follows. Suppose the atmosphere goes up to a height H. Since, there would be nothing above it, the pressure will be zero there. If we want pressure at height <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> from the sea level, we will just use the weight of air above <span class="process-math">\(h\text{,}\)</span> which will be the air of a column of height <span class="process-math">\(H-h\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the pressure at height <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> would be</div>
