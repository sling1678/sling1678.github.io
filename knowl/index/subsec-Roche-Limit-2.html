<div class="para"> Naturally, the tidal forces have enormous  consequences in Astronomy since the forces in large object dealt in the Astronomy are considerable compared to the binding forces among materials.  Astronomical objects, such as stars, planets, moons, and comets are held together by gravitational attraction, and nearby astronomical objects exert enormous tidal forces on them. If an Astronomical object comes too close to a more massive Astronomical object, it can get disintegrated due to the tidal forces. The critical distance when this happens is called the  <dfn class="terminology">Roche limit</dfn> after the French physicist Edouard Roche.</div>
