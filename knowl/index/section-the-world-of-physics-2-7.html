<em class="alert">Theories to Laws.</em> <dfn class="terminology">Theories</dfn> in physics range from the empirical to the abstract. Often a theory is simply a model or a mental image that helps grasp the experimental observations better. Theories may also suggest new experiments to render the physical situation clearer.  Physicists also explore theories that seek to unearth the abstract principles that can explain a number of phenomena. Although the words - theory and model - are often used interchangeably, theories are usually understood to mean more general ideas while models usually refer to a particular phenomenon.</div>
