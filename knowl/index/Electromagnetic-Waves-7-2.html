<div class="para"> In the above subsection, we looked at a particular direction of wave.  We found that when the wave was traveling towards the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis with  the electric field  pointed towards the positive <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis and the magnetic field vector pointed towards the positive <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span>-axis. This wave has the directions of the electric and magnetic fields in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the propagation of the wave as shown in <a href="Electromagnetic-Waves.html#fig-em-wave-pic" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-em-wave-pic.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 42.6">FigureÂ 42.6</a>.   This type of wave is called a <dfn class="terminology">transverse wave</dfn> since the oscillations of the wave occur in the plane normal to the propagation.  This is a general property of the electromagnetic waves in vacuum and in most materials, but not in all materials.</div>
