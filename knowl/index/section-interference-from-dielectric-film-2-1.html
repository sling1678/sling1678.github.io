<div class="para"> You have probably seen colored bands on soap bubbles. <a href="section-interference-from-dielectric-film.html#fig-Macro_Photography_of_a_soap_bubble" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-Macro_Photography_of_a_soap_bubble.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 47.13">Figure 47.13</a> from Wikipedia show separation of colors by a soap film. This is different than the separation of colors when rainbow forms across the sky. Rainbow occurs occurs due to difference in refractive index for different colors. Here, as we will see below, the pattern is due to interference of two reflected waves. A soap film is a thin film of water and we get light reflected from front at air/water interface and another reflection from water/air interface at the back of the film facing inside of the bubble.  Since the angles of interference depend on the wavelength, you see different colors in different directions. You also see repeat of color pattern due to the different orders of interference as we saw in Young’s double slit experiment in <a href="section-youngs-double-slit-expt.html" class="internal" title="Section 47.2: Young’s Double-Slit Experiment">Section 47.2</a>. </div>
