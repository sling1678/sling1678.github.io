<div class="para"> Radiometry gives us the objective measure of energy and power of light sources.  However, human eye does not respond to all colors of visible light equally. Consequenctly, we perceive intensities differently than an objective instrument.  For instance, experiments have shown that, during the day (i.e., photopic vision), the eye is most sensitive to the yellow-green (at around wavelength of <span class="process-math">\(555\,\text{nm}\)</span>) light than to the red and blue lights of the spectrum.  Therefore, yellow-green light will appears brighter to our eyes than either the red or the blue light of the same intensity. At night (i.e., scotopic vision) the sensitivity blue shifts with peak around <span class="process-math">\(505\,\text{nm}\)</span> wavelength.</div>
