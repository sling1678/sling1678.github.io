<div class="para"> A general lesson of Fermatâ€™s principle is that, in order to understand physical reality at the deepest levels, we need to find some physical aspect of a system that nature is trying to <em class="alert">optimize</em> - in the case of light, it is the time of travel that nature optimizes, and in other systems, it may be something else. This way of thinking led to the discovery of principle of least action, upon which classical mechanics can be understood. As a matter of fact, not only classical mechanics but also the entirety of fundamental physics relies on extensions of this principle.</div>
