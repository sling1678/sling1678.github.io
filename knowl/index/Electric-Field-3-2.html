<div class="para"> Following Faraday, we envision the entire space being permeated by invisible lines. At each point in space, they represent a vector, which we will call <dfn class="terminology">electric field</dfn> vector. We will denote it by symbol <span class="process-math">\(\vec E\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\vec E_P\text{,}\)</span> where subscript <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> refers to the space point of interest. When we place a charge <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> at point P, this charge will experience an electric force whose maganitude is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
F_e = Q\,E,\tag{29.13}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">and the direction of the force is same as that of <span class="process-math">\(\vec E\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is positive, and opposite to <span class="process-math">\(\vec E\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is negative. The SI unit of electric field will be <span class="process-math">\(\text{N/C}\text{.}\)</span>  We can write force/electric field relation as a vector equation as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\vec F = Q\, \vec E.\tag{29.14}

<div class="para">By measuring force on charge <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> we can deduce the electric field by dividing the measured force by charge.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\vec E = \dfrac{\vec F}{Q}.\tag{29.15}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para"> Note that charge <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is only “feeling” or “discovering” the electric field that already exists at its location due to other charges somewhere else.  We call the <span class="process-math">\(feeler\)</span> charge <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> the <dfn class="terminology">test charge</dfn> and the other charges whose electric field the test charge is responding to are called the <dfn class="terminology">source charge</dfn> or just charges. The space point P, where we have placed charge <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is called the <dfn class="terminology">field point</dfn>.  It is important to note that:</div>
