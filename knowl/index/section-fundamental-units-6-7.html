<div class="para">The unit of kilogram defined by an artefact has some intrinsic problems.  For instance, the prototype may be damaged or corrode due to oxidation or other wear and tear.  As a result of these problems, the prototype is said to be gaining approximately 1 micro-gram per year.  Therefore, it is hard to keep the standard kilogram constant to a very high degree of precision.  Presently, several new methods for defining kilogram are being investigated.  A particularly attractive possibility is to define the kilogram based on the mass of a fixed number of molecules of a substance that can be made with high purity.  In another method developed at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), force of gravity on a standard kilogram is balanced by magnetic force between two coils in a <dfn class="terminology">Watt balance</dfn> (<a href="section-fundamental-units.html#fig-nist-watt-balance" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-nist-watt-balance.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 1.6">FigureÂ 1.6</a>). </div>
