<div class="para">A block attached to a spring provides an ideal model system to study harmonic oscillations. We often call this model system a <dfn class="terminology">simple harmonic oscillator (SHO)</dfn>.  In real blocks attached to spring, friction and drag forces take away energy and damp the motion of the block, eventually stopping it. But, in this section, we will not worry about these effects. As a result, we will get a perpetual motion -  the block attached to an ideal spring will oscillate for ever! In a later section we will address damping as well as how additional energy can be put into the block to keep it going. </div>
