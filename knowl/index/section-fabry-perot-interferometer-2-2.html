<div class="para"> A <dfn class="terminology">Fabry-Perot interferometer</dfn> shown in <a href="section-fabry-perot-interferometer.html#fig-fabry-perot-interferometer-setup" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-fabry-perot-interferometer-setup.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 47.27">FigureÂ 47.27</a> essentially consists of two parallel plates of glass whose inner surfaces are polished to a very high degree of flatness, and then coated with a highly reflecting thin film of silver or aluminum or some similarly good reflector.  The outer surface of these plates are ground to make a wedge shape so that light escaping the cavity between the plates does not reflect back in.  The distance <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> between plates can vary from a few millimeters to a few centimeters. Rays of light from an extended source enter the space between the reflecting plates, and  emerge on both sides after each reflection.  The rays emerging on the opposite end to the side of entrance are focused on a screen.</div>
