<div class="para"> A device that does a conversion of heat to some other form of energy in a continuous process is called a <dfn class="terminology">heat engine</dfn>.  A heat engine must work in a cyclic process for the engine to convert heat to work continuously.  <a href="The-Heat-Engine.html#fig-heat-engine" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-heat-engine.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 25.1">FigureÂ 25.1</a>  shows <em class="emphasis">the energy cycle of a heat engine</em> schematically.
