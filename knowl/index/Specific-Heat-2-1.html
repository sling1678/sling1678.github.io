<div class="para">The amount of heat that can change the temperature of a body by one degree is called the <dfn class="terminology">heat capacity</dfn> of the body. Therefore, if heat <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> raises the temperature by <span class="process-math">\(\Delta T\)</span> then the heat capacity would be</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
\text{Heat Capacity } = \dfrac{Q}{\Delta T}.\tag{22.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para"> Heat capacity is a misleading term, since it seems to imply that heat may be contained in the system rather than having only a transitory nature.  Although the term “heat capacity” is still in use in certain disciplines such as Chemistry, but in Physics we don’t use this term any more. Instead, physicists prefer a related concept called specific heat.</div>
