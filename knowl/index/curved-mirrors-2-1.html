<div class="para"> You saw in the section above that the image in a plane mirror has the same size as the object and forms at the same distance behind the mirror as the object is located in front of the mirror.  A <dfn class="terminology">curved mirror</dfn>, on the other hand, can form images that may be larger or smaller than the object and may form either in front of the mirror or behind it. Because of the variety of images possible, curved mirrors are exciting optical devices that find many applications.</div>
