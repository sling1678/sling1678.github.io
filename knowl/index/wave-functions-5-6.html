<div class="para"> Similarly, suppose you turn a Laser on for a very brief period, you would get a pulse of light wave.  Or, if you hit a piano key, there again you will get a pulse of sound wave.  In these cases, you produce waves of some particular frequency, but let it last only for a short period of time - these periods often contain tens to hundreds of cycles of the wave. Since the cycles do not last for ever, mathematically, they are not really sinusoidal, but sometimes, it is okay to treat them as if they were purely sinusoidal or plane waves. These waves are called <dfn class="terminology">wavetrains</dfn>. In a future course, you might learn Fourier anlaysis and there you will learn how to better analyze them analytically.</div>
