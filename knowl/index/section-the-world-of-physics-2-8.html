<div class="para"> When many predictions of a general theory have been tested and found to be correct, the theory  gains the status of a <dfn class="terminology">law of physics</dfn>. There is a self-propelled process in the testing process. The testing of predictions of laws of physics is usually limited by development in technology, which itself is  guided by a progress in physics, and/or the human ingenuity.  With increased precision, or an access to some previously inaccessible physical conditions, or some hitherto unimagined experiment, the old accepted laws are often tested in new ways.</div>
