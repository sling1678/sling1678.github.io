<div class="para"> A damped oscillator  will eventually come to rest if no additional energy is supplied to it.  To supply energy to the oscillator you could apply any force that will do a net positive work on the oscillator.  Among many forces that will do the job, a harmonically time varying force is of particular interest in physics for many applications.  A harmonically varying force varies in time sinusoidally with a well-defined frequency, which we will denote by  <span class="process-math">\(\omega_d\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation}
F_d = F_0\, \cos(\omega_d\, t).\tag{13.67}
\end{equation}
</div>
<div class="para">where <span class="process-math">\(F_0\)</span> is the amplitude of the force.  Note that  <span class="process-math">\(\omega_d=0\)</span> corresponds to just a constant force, such as gravity; a constant force will do positive work in one half of the cycle and the same amount of negative work in the second half of the cycle, therefore a constant force will not change the energy of the oscillator over one complete cycle.</div>
