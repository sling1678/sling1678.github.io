<div class="para"> Soon people began to wonder whether the reverse was also true, i.e., a magnetic field would produce an electric current as well. Most of experiments to test this reverse process didn’t work out.  For instance, strong magnets next to a wire failed to produce any  detectable current in the wire.  Even the magnetic field produced by large steady currents in a wire failed to cause any current in a loop of wire next to the first wire.  We call these experiments <dfn class="terminology">null experiments</dfn> since the result is zero. They are illustrated in <a href="faradays-experiments.html#fig-faraday-expt-0-0" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-faraday-expt-0-0.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 38.1">Figure 38.1</a>.  The key was using the changing magnetic field as we will see below.</div>
