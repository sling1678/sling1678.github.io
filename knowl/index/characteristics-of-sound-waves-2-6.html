<div class="para"> Both light and sound have (1) physically measurable characteristics and (2) human-perceived characteristics. For instance, frequency and intensity of sound can be measured by instruments which provide objective measures of the wave. However, we also have measures based on uman perception -  perception of frequency is called <dfn class="terminology">pitch</dfn> and perception of intensity is called <dfn class="terminology">loudness</dfn> which can be subjective and perception may vary from one person to another.</div>
