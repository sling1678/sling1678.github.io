</h4> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para"> We find that the power of the source disappears when the resistance in the circuit is zero.  Thus a purely reactive circuit does not use any energy.  But you need a current for a reactive device such as a motor to function.  Therefore, although no energy is used by a purely reactive device, the power supply company must supply a current to it. The product <span class="process-math">\(\left(V_{\text{rms}}.I_{\text{rms}}\right)\)</span> is sometimes called the <dfn class="terminology">real power</dfn> for which the power supplier must charge the power user, and not just the <dfn class="terminology">apparent power</dfn>. The power factor is the ratio of the power of the source, i.e. the “apparent power”, to the <dfn class="terminology">actual power</dfn> used in the resistor, i.e., the “real power”.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/xref/eq-power-factor.html">
\begin{equation*}
\text{Power Factor} = \frac{\text{Apparent Power}}{\text{Real Power}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">The power factor therefore gives a measure of the reactive part of the power usage.  The power factor should be maximized so as to make the delivery of power more efficient.  The power factor of a circuit with large inductors can be increased by adding a capacitor to the circuit as you can see from Eq. <a href="Power-in-AC-Circuits.html#eq-power-factor" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/eq-power-factor.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Equation 41.40">(41.40)</a>.</div>
