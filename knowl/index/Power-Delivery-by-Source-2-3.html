<div class="para"> The curve shows that the <dfn class="terminology">maximum power</dfn> is delivered to the circuit when the circuit is driven at the natural frequency.  Denoting the resonance frequency of power as <span class="process-math">\(\omega_R\)</span> we have</div>

<div class="para">This formula for the average power in the resistor differs from the power for the constant current circuit we had found in an earlier chapter.  There, we had found that the power dissipated in a resistor is <span class="process-math">\(I^2R\text{,}\)</span> but here we find that the average power is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}I_0^2R\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(I_0\)</span> is the amplitude of the oscillating current, which changes between <span class="process-math">\(-I_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(+I_0\)</span> sinusoidally in time. It is possible to define an averaged current, called the {\bf root-mean squared current}, or the {\bf RMS-current}, \index{RMS current} we can rewrite the average power <span class="process-math">\(P_{\textrm{ave}}\)</span> as a formula that is similar to a DC circuit.</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
I_{\textrm{rms}} = \frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}}

<div class="para"> This will give the <dfn class="terminology">average power</dfn> dissipated as</div>
