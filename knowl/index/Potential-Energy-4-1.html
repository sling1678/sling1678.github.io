<div class="para"> Previously we have studied energy due to motion, called kinetic energy. Now, we look at energy associated with position, which is called potential energy. It is based on the observation that work by a class of forces, which will be called <dfn class="terminology">conservative forces</dfn>, do not depend on the path of motion but just the initial and final positions.  Weight, spring force, Newton’s gravitational force, and Coulomb’s electric force are common examples of conservative forces.</div>
