<div class="para"> Since the frequency of the visible light is very high (of the order of <span class="process-math">\(10^{14}\)</span> cycles per second) the power flux will be an extremely rapidly varying quantity.  Our eyes as well as most light energy measuring instruments cannot respond this fast and only an average energy over many cycles is observed.  The quantity obtained by time-averaging the power flux is called the <dfn class="terminology">intensity</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">irradiance</dfn> and it is normally denoted by <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span>

Note that time-averaging of the expression for the power flux given in Eq. <a href="section-intensity-of-light.html#section-intensity-of-light-2-4-6" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/eq-power-flux-in-form-twice-the-angle.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Equation 46.19">(46.19)</a>  is easily performed by noting that it has a constant part and a part that fluctuates between <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> The avergage of the fluctuating part over any integral multiple of cycles will be zero. Therefore, time average over long times will give a zero for the fluctuating part.</div>
