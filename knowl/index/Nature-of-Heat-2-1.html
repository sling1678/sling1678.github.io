<div class="para"> Prior to the nineteenth century, scientists thought that the sense of hot and cold was related with the amount of heat a body contained.  The theory was called the <dfn class="terminology">caloric theory</dfn>.  In the caloric theory, heat is considered to be a “weightless fluid” that flowed from a hot body to a cold body with the total quantity being conserved. This viewpoint of heat is no longer held since experiments have suggested better ways of looking at the phenomena involving heat as we will see below.</div>
