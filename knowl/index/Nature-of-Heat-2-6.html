<div class="para"> A clearer demonstration of the mechanical equivalence of heat was provided by <dfn class="terminology">James Joule</dfn> in England in 1840’s.  To demonstrate the equivalence of mechanical energy and heat, Joule constructed a device where he could measure mechanical energy and thermal energy at the same time.  In his device, a sketch of which is shown in <a href="Nature-of-Heat.html#fig-joule-expt" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/fig-joule-expt.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 19.1">Figure 19.1</a>,  paddle wheels attached to a shaft were placed in a set amount of water in a copper cylinder.  The shaft rotated when the strings wrapped over it unwound when the two masses fell.  Joule expected that the rotating paddle wheels would force the water molecules to rub against one another and produce heat as a result of the friction between the paddle wheel and the liquid.</div>
