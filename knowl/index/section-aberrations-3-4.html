<div class="para"> Rays that make a small angle  to the optical axis are called paraxial rays and other rays  are called the marginal rays.  From the figure it is clear that there are several images of one point object P that fall between the image  <span class="process-math">\(\text{Q}_1\)</span> formed by the paraxial rays and the image  <span class="process-math">\(\text{Q}_2\)</span> formed by the marginal rays.  The distance between the images is a measure of <dfn class="terminology">spherical aberration</dfn>.  The best image of the object is seen at a point between <span class="process-math">\(\text{Q}_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\text{Q}_2\text{,}\)</span> which is called the <dfn class="terminology">circle of least confusion</dfn>.</div>
