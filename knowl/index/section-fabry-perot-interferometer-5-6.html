<div class="para"> How do we tell if two nearby wavelengths are separated? This is the same type of question as we had when we were studying telescopes. There, the question was how to tell if we could tell whether there were two stars or one star on the CCD. A commonly used criteria, called <dfn class="terminology">Raleigh criterion</dfn> is that if the maximum of peak of one will be at less than half-width from the other peak, then we cannot be sure there are two peaks.</div>
