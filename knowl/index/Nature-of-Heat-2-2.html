<div class="para"> In 1798 <dfn class="terminology">Count Rumford</dfn>, born as Benjamin Thompson in Massachusetts, USA, presented a paper to the Royal Society of Great Britain in which he described the results of a series of experiments conducted in Munich, Germany concerning heat associated with the boring of cannons.  He had observed that in the drilling of canons, the cannons became blazingly hot and water poured to cool them also became very hot. After a series of careful measurements he found that the amount of heat released into water would be enough to completely melt the canon if it could be returned to the metal.  Therefore, he concluded that more heat was being released in the drilling process than could have been originally contained in the metal.  This observation contradicted the caloric theory.  Rumford concluded that it was the mechanical process of boring that was responsible for heat production and not the supposedly heat present in the metal beforehand.  In his own words,</div>
