<div class="para"> One of the early successes of Maxwell’s equations was the prediction  that light consists of electromagnetic waves. Maxwell came to  this conclusion by examining his equations in vacuum. He found that his equations simplify to wave equations for electric and magnetic fields with wave speed given by</div>

Maxwell noticed this coincidence and asserted that this mathematical result  implied that light is an electromagnetic wave.  At that time light was an independent field of study.  This conclusion unified the subjects of electricity, magnetism, and optics, and made optics a subfield of electricity and magnetism.</div>
